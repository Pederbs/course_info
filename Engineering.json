In regular classes, problems\nconcerning the modelling and the design of reinforced concrete\nstructures are discussed. Finally, details of nodes, steel\npositioning, etc. will be shown and discussed. Guidelines for\ndifferent structural problems reported in national and\ninternational codes will be considered. Some classes will be\ndevoted to show designs of actual realizations concerning the\nsubjects of regular classes.\nAssessment methods\nEach didactic\nunit has its own final verification.\n6 CFU Unit:\nFinal mark will be given according to a series of written tests (one homework, a midterm and a finalterm) and a facoltative\noral colloquium. The oral colloquium is for the students which want to improve the grade of the written part. During the oral will be verified the personal preparation of the student and his knowledge about the main theoretical aspects of the course.\n3 CFU Unit: Single final test. It can be taken in written form (1 hour) or in oral form. In any case, it consists of three questions: two theoretical ones (each 11-points valid) and one “numerical” (numerical application, order of magnitude, important gross numbers, …, 8-points valid).\nThe final judgment of the student is calculated as  weighted average on CFU of the two modules.\nThe oral tests are composed of two questions, and the assessment procedure will clarify if the student acquired a sufficient number of the predicted learning outcomes.\nThey aim to establish the knowledge and skills achieved by the student as well as to evaluate its technical language with reference to the topics discussed. Passing of the exam will be granted to students who demonstrate mastery and operational capacity in relation to the key-concepts discussed in the course showing, in particular, that the student learned the basic theoretical concepts and is able to argue in a comprehensive manner and in autonomous way the various steps leading to the definition of the main results. The higher scores will be awarded to students who demonstrate to understand with breadth of content and appropriate language, the subjects taught and, further, will show to be able to apply all the teaching content in operating autonomy even for the most complex cases. Failure to pass the exam will be due instead to insufficient knowledge of the key-concepts (such as the static equilibrium rules), failure to properly master technical language, or it can be due to low operational autonomy shown in the performance of the tests.\nTeaching tools\nBlackboard, slide presentations showed by videoprojector, further notes on shells and plates elements as integration of the class notes uploaded on the IOL web-site\n\nSomo discussion moments will be possible to comment the answers provided by student to questions concerning the course topics.\n\nLinks to further information\nhttp://corsi.unibo.it/Civil-Engineering/Pages/default.aspx\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Claudio Mazzotti\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Stefano Silvestri"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course, the student has the skills required for designing a system composed of one or multiple robotic agents. In particular, the student has a knowledge of the most popular models, methods, architectures, and tools for programming robotic agents endowed with significant computational and cognitive capabilities.\nCourse contents\nThe course will cover several topics in robotics. For each topic, we will first introduce it, and then discuss how it can be addressed using AI techniques, and what are the gains and challenges in doing so.\n\nHere are the topics addressed, and the corresponding AI solutions that will be explored:\n\nBasic concepts, methods and tools in robotics\nState estimation, and how to address it using reasoning under uncertainty (Bayesian approaches, fuzzy sets, Dempster-Shafer theory)\nMotion control, and how to address it using rule-based logical systems (fuzzy logic control)\nAction planning, and how to address it using AI planning systems (hierarchical HTN planning)\nHuman-robot interaction, and how to address it using knowledge representation systems (semantic maps)\nPutting it all together, using cognitive robotic architectures\nOutlook: socio-ethical issues, and the research frontier\n\n\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nReading material for each lecture will be posted on Virtuale together with the lecture.\n\n \nTeaching methods\nThe course will alternate three types of activities: presentation of concepts and problems in robotics, discussion on how AI techniques can be used to address those problems, and practical exercises.\nEach activity will involve a mixture of frontal lectures, group discussions, and laboratory work.\n\nFrontal lectures will be in presence and they will require the active participation and interaction of students; lectures will not be recorded.\nGroup discussions will be in-classroom sessions on specific topics; each session will start with presentations given by students, and continue with an open floor discussion.\nLaboratory work will consist in the execution of six assignments related to the above topics; each assignment will be introduced in the classroom, and it will then be performed autonomously by the students on their own computer outside the scheduled class times; the final (sixth) assignment will integrate all the previous ones, and it will be the basis for the oral examination (more below).\n\nIn-person attendance to all classroom activities (lectures, discussions and introduction to assignment) is required.\n\n\nAssessment methods\nThe exam consists of three parts.\n\nPart I: correct execution of all the laboratory assignments. This part aims at assessing the student's ability to use AI techniques in practical robotic systems; the grade of this part is pass or fail. Every assignment must be demonstrated to the TA, and documented in a written report; to pass, all the reports must be approved by the TA.\nPart II: delivery of a short presentation at one of the group discussion sessions, on a topic assigned by the teacher. This part aims at assessing the student's ability to critically appraise research work in AI and robotics; the grade of this part is pass or fail. Topics and guidelines for these presentations will be communicated within the first three weeks of the course, and posted in Virtuale. \nPart III: oral discussion of the final laboratory assignment. This part aims at assessing the student's knowledge of the course topics, the ability to critically analyse design choices, and the correct usage of the technical terminology. The discussion will be based on the report of the final assignment, but it may involve topics in the course beyond that. Detailed grading criteria will be communicated during the course.\n\nParts I and II must be passed in order to proceed to Part III; the final grade of the course is the one of Part III. A more detailed description of the assessment procedure and evaluation criteria is published in Virtuale.\n\n\nTeaching tools\nWe will use \"Virtuale\" for distribution of learning material and online discussions.\nLearning material will include: lecture slides, research papers, book excerpts, and links to public contents on the Internet.\nAll laboratory assignments will require the use of ROS and Gazebo, available as open source: you will need to install them on your personal computers. Installation instructions and tutorials are available online, e.g., at https://www.ros.org and https://gazebosim.org.\nNote that ROS and Gazebo work best on Linux (we will use Ubuntu 20.04) so you should have it installed on your computer. You also need a good understanding of Linux shell commands, and Python and C++ programming knowledge. It is possible to use ROS and Gazebo on MacOS or Windows, but this is not recommended and may bring difficulties. Using an Ubuntu virtual machine is an acceptable option.\n\n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Alessandro Saffiotti"

Examples are implemented in Python on Linux installed in a virtual machine (VM). The VMs will be installed in the students’ own laptops. Full instructions on how to install the VMs will be given in the first lesson.\nAssessment methods\nThe exam of the two modules is performed with a single sit and consist of two parts:\n\n1. the Verification of knowledge is tested through multiple choice questions (administered with the IoL or virtuale system). The minimum to pass this part is to answer correctly 50% of the questions of each module.\nThe weight of this part is 60%.\n2. the Verification of abilities is tested with the development of a lab project work on one (or optionally more) of the two modules selected by the students. The students, individually or in a team of up to 3 members, proposes a project to the teacher of the module selected and discusses it with the involved teacher. Each student discusses the discussion individually. \nThe size/extension of the project should be approximately equivalent to that of a lab of the module(s) selected and should take one week of work.\nA non-exhaustive list of dataset and text sets for the project is available in the \"virtuale\" teaching resources, but the students can also propose to use a different data set.\nThe weight of this part is 40%.\nTeaching tools\nModule 1 - Text Mining (Prof. Gianluca Moro)\n\nThe laboratory activities - which are carried out with Python/R using Colab - regard the following case studies:\n\nin the context of technical reports on air accidents, identification of the reasons that contribute to cause serious accidents\nextractive and abstractive text summarisation based on state-of-the-art transformer models\ndeep metric learning for cross-modal information retrieval of texts and images\nSOTA transformers for closed and open question answering, for named entity recognition (NER), for relation extraction (RE) among biomedical entities for chemical-protein and disease-disease interactions respectively, for natural language inference (NLI) to determine the validity of a hypothesis (i.e., true or false), document classification (DC) to assign a text document to a set of categories\n\n\n \n\nModule 2 - Big Data Analytics (Prof. Stefano Lodi)\nPresentation of the course topics using a overhead\nprojector.

Each group is asked to design a plant for the production of a biomolecule.

A literature search for data may be required to complete the project.\n\nAssessment methods\nAchievements will be assessed with the design project and the final exam. The final exam consists of a written test and an oral examination.  \n This is based on analytical assessment of the \"expected learning outcomes\" as described above, and in particular, at the end of the course the student should be able to:\n\nKnowledge of the main unit operations of a biotech process.\n\n\nMaster the fundamentals of bioreactors.\n\n\nUnderstand the principles behind a given separation process and size the apparatus.\n\n\nDesign a bioprocess as a sequence of unit operations.\n\nThe purpose of the written test is to ensure admission to the oral exam. It consists of 10 questions, some of which may require simple calculations. The written test is passed with 6 correct answers, but the score is not used for the final grade.\nThe final grade for the course is defined as the sum of the evaluation of the oral exam (70%) and the project that the student must present at the end of the course (30%).\nHigher grades will be awarded to students who demonstrate a deep understanding of bioprocessing and a clear and concise presentation of the course contents, together with the capability to carry on a technical conversation.\n\nTo obtain a passing grade, students are required to demonstrate a knowledge ot the basic principles of the main unit operations of a bioprocess and a comprehensible use of technical language.\nA failing grade will be awarded if the student shows knowledge gaps on the key concepts of the course, on basic chemical engineering principles and inappropriate use of technical language.\nA passing grade (a mark greater than or equal to 18/30) can only be refused once.\n\nTeaching tools\nA combination of blackboard and slide projector according to the lecture topic.\nPower point presentations that will be made available on Virtuale with access to University of Bologna students.\nReading material that will be made available during the course in a shared folder on Onedrive as well as guided suggestions for individual literature search. \nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Cristiana Boi\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Riccardo Onesti"

Answers must be provided in English. \nA total time of 60 minutes is allowed for the exam. The exam consists of a written exam including 3 open questions\n\n\n2 open questions on the topics covered in Module 1 (Prof. Starita).\n\n1 open question on the topics covered in Module 2 (Prof. di Pellegrino)\n\n\nUp to 30 points are assigned for each open question, and the final score (out of thirty) is given by the average of the points obtained on each question. \nThe following areas will be considered to evaluate each answer:  \n\nAnalysis/critical thinking \n\nAbility to select, consider, evaluate, the course material relevant to answering the question. \nUse of appropriate definitions for the concepts prompted by the exam questions. \nUnderstanding of relevant concepts, through proper analysis of the course material. \nAbility to synthesize and employ in an original way ideas from across the course. \nDiscussion of relevant evidence to support assertions (e.g. discussion of experimental evidence, use of citations/references). \n\nStructure \n\nClarity of introduction, body, and conclusion \nClear, logical and well-organized flow of information. \n\nStyle \n\nPrecision of vocabulary and use of academic tone. \nClarity and conciseness of sentences, with minimal verbosity. \nUse of appropriate grammar, sentence construction, paragraph structure. \n\nDuring the exam, students are not allowed to use any lecture material nor books, scientific articles, personal notes, or electronic media.\nStudent must enroll in the exam using the Almaesami application, strictly by the deadline. Those who fail to enroll for technical issues by the due date are required to report the problem to the “segreteria didattica” (and in any case before the deadline) and send an email to Prof. Starita, who will ultimately decide whether to admit the student to take the exam.\nThe exam will be taken on the lab computers through EOL.\n\nThe exam grade will be registered on the 5th working day following the date of publication of the results. Students who want to refuse their grade need to write an email to Prof. Starita stating the whish to refuse, otherwise their grade will be registered. You can refuse the grade as many times as you want, but you must do it within the 5 working days following the date of publication of the results, otherwise your grade will be registered.\nTeaching tools\nPowerPoint slides, Video Clips, scientific articles\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Francesca Starita\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Giuseppe Di Pellegrino"

This Module details the architectures, signal buses, and electronic control units employed for intra-vehicle networking and analyzes network topologies and data formats. Several technologies are compared and put in context with present and future applications.\n\nModule 3: Introduction to Modern Cryptography, Security, and Privacy\nAfter an overview of classical ciphers and their cryptanalysis, we will see in detail the scientific principles that support modern cryptography, as well as different classes of attack. Once the fundamentals have been established, we will look into different security definitions and explore security, integrity, and authentication in both private-key and public-key settings, from the underlying principles to modern ciphers.\n\nNotes\nThe learning outcomes on top are outdated.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course, the student has basic notions of complexity and network sciences and is able to identify, formulate, model and analyze new problems that arise in modern computing systems that can be studied using them.\nCourse contents\nDescription: Modern information systems and services often rely on large numbers of independent interacting components to provide their functions. Under certain conditions, the behavior that results from these interactions can be unexpected and surprising. Complexity Science is an interdisciplinary field for studying global behaviors resulting from many simple local interactions in an effort to characterize and control them. Networks allow us to formalize the structure of interactions. They play a central role in the transmission of information, transportation of goods, spread of diseases, diffusion of innovation, formation of opinions and adoption of new technologies. Network Science is an interdisciplinary field for studying the interconnectedness of modern life by exploring fundamental properties that govern the structure and dynamic evolution of networks.\nContents: Complex systems: definitions, methodologies; Dynamical systems, Nonlinear dynamics; Chaos, Bifurcations and Feigenbaum constant, Predictability, Randomness and Chaos; Models of complex systems, Cellular automata, Wolfram's classification, Game of life; Autonomous agents, Flocking, Schooling, Synchronization, Formation creation; Cooperation and Competition, Game theory basics, Nash equilibrium; Game theory: Prisoner's Dilemma, Coordination games, Mixed strategy games; Adaptation, Evolution, Genetic algorithms, Evolutionary games; Network Science: Definitions and examples; Graph theory, Basic concepts and definitions; Diameter, Path length, Clustering, Centrality metrics; Structure of real networks, Degree distribution, Power-laws, Popularity; Models of network formation; The Erdos-Renyi random model; Clustered models; Models of network growth, Preferential attachment; Small-world networks, Network navigation; Peer-to-peer systems and overlay networks; Structured overlays, DHTs, Key-based routing, Chord; Distributed network formation: Newscast, Cyclon, T-Man; Processes on networks: Aggregation; Rational dynamics: Cooperation in selfish environments, Homophily, Segregation; Diffusion, Percolation, Tipping points, Peer-effects, Cascades.\nPrerequisites: Basic notions of computer system architecture, computer networks, operating systems, and probability theory.\nReadings/Bibliography\n\nNetworks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World, D.

A. El-Reedy, Offshore Structures: Design, Construction and Maintenance, Elsevier, Inc., 2012.\n N. D. P. Barltrop and A. J. Adams, Dynamics of fixed marine structures, Thomson Litho Ltd., East Kilbride, Scotland, 3rd edition 1991.\n\n \nOther readings:\n\nMarshall, P. W. (2013). Design of welded tubular connections: Basis and use of AWS code provisions (Vol. 37). Elsevier.\n\nTeaching methods\n\nIn regular classes, problems concerning the modelling and the design of off-shore structures are discussed. Finally, details of nodes, connections, etc. will be shown and discussed. Guidelines for different structural problems reported in the international codes will be considered. Some classes will be devoted to show designs of some examples concerning the subjects of regular classes.\nAssessment methods\nAssessment will be given according to a midterm and final written tests and a possible oral colloquium. During the written tests the pratical skills of the student in solving exercises of design and verification will be checked. In the oral will be verified the personal preparation of the student and his knowledge on the main theoretical aspects of the course.\nThe oral tests are composed of two questions, and the assessment procedure will clarify if the student acquired a sufficient number of the predicted learning outcomes.\nThey aim to establish the knowledge and skills achieved by the student as well as to evaluate its technical language with reference to the topics discussed. Passing of the exam will be granted to students who demonstrate mastery and operational capacity in relation to the key-concepts discussed in the course showing, in particular, that the student learned the basic theoretical concepts and is able to argue in a comprehensive manner and in autonomous way the various steps leading to the definition of the main results. The higher scores will be awarded to students who demonstrate to understand with breadth of content and appropriate language, the subjects taught and, further, will show to be able to apply all the teaching content in operating autonomy even for the most complex cases. Failure to pass the exam will be due instead to insufficient knowledge of the key-concepts, failure to properly master technical language, or it can be due to low operational autonomy shown in the performance of the tests.\nTeaching tools\nBlackboard, slide presentations showed by videoprojector during classes.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Michele Palermo"

The latter will be aimed at the creation of a final paper (graphic tables and summary report) and will be carried out individually under the supervision of the teacher. \nThe activities in the computer lab will be aimed at the graphic rendering of a project idea on a theme suggested by the teacher. In particular, the student will be asked to represent general layouts, functional schemes, construction details and architectural-structural elements. The final drawings, accompanied by a brief report, will be discussed and reviewed in the classroom with the teacher and evaluated during the final exam.\nAssessment methods\nThe knowledge and skills of this teaching are assessed in the following way. During the final exam, the knowledge and skills acquired on each of the two modules are assessed.\nThe learning evaluation of the contents of course involves an oral exam in which the teachers will evaluate:\n\nthe final papers (design and report produced under the supervision of the teachers);\ntheir defense;\nknowledge and preparation achieved on the theoretical part through specific questions.\n\nThe overall assessment is made by the Commission taking into account:\n\nfor the theoretical part: the knowledge and skill level achieved by the student on the contents of all the teaching units;\nfor the graphic documents: the contents, clarity, consistency, and graphical quality.\n\nMarks are expressed as a score out of 30.\nTo pass the exam the student has to show to have acquired sufficient knowledge on the course contents. To achieve the honors, an autonomous and competent capability to deal with in-depth analysis on the discussed subjects is required.\nMissing the theoretical lectures or exercises does not preclude passing the exam: those who cannot attend must contact the teacher to contact a replacement activity.\nExamination dates, times and locations are published on the degree course website.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course focuses on the design and management of coastal structures and harbors, as well as the assessment of their environmental impact and sustainability. Tools for the analysis and design of coastal defenses, onshore approach facilities and harbors (docks, breakwater etc) will be discussed. Student will learn how to assess sea forcings (waves, currents) and design coastal structures in the presence of climate change and human impacted environment. \nMoreover, it addresses the geotechnical issues in the design of harbour structures and infrastructures like quays and breakwaters, land reclamation and bank protection.\nCourse contents\nThe teacher will adopt an innovative approach to learning, which makes extensive use of interaction with students. Accordingly, students will be given the optional opportunity of delivering presentations to the class and the public, developing software, preparing open source contributions to be published on the web. The educational approach adopted by the teacher takes the technical application as the central thread of the lectures. An intensive interaction with the students will be established through web based discussions (see also https://www.albertomontanari.it/node/154). An example of tutorial is given at https://www.albertomontanari.it/node/97). \nThe lectures include: (1) Introduction to coastal and harbour engineering; (2) The coastal environment and terminology; (3) Port planning and environmental impact; (4) Harbour layout, shore infrastructure and utilities; (5) Fundamentals of port structures design, design codes, guidelines and functional requirements; (6) Design of coastal protections; (7) Design of breakwaters and of typical harbour retaining structures; (8) Land reclamation; (9) Climate change impact and mitigation.\nComputer based exercises will be developed which will focus on technical applications.\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe teachers will prepare dynamic documents to support the learning process, which will be made available in the form of open web pages, which will be open to interactive contribution by students (see https://www.albertomontanari.it/node/217).\nTeaching methods\nStudents should preliminarily possess knowledge of ocean engineering, in particular wave theory, and of geotechnical engineering.\n The course is taught through lectures. Part of them are dedicated to the solution of practical exercises, that are developed at the computer. Site visits can be arranged.\nAssessment methods\nThe preparation of the student will be assessed through an oral colloquium whose duration is about 30 minutes. The student may present at the exam a brief report of the exercises that were developed during the course. Students are asked to reply to 3-4 questions focusing on the topics that were treated during the lectures. Students may be asked to solve a short exercise. The exam is passed if the student proves to be prepared on the theoretical principles and analytical derivations that were taught during the lectures. The teacher will explicitly mention to students during the lectures what are the basic questions that one needs to rigorously address in order to pass the exam. The speaking capability will also be evaluated but it is not a cause of failure. The laude is reserved to students who are excellently prepared and prove to have integrated their preparation with personal in-depth analysis.\nTeaching tools\nThe teachers will made available their lecture notes on Virtuale. Scientific papers will be distributed during the lectures as well as summaries of recent research outcomes. \nFor more details please see https://www.albertomontanari.it/node/217.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n                Office hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Alberto Montanari\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Renata Archetti\n                        \n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Alessio Mentani"

Laboratory exercises will be carried out by using commercial CAD tools for the design of microwave and mm-wave circuits and they will be held either in the Laboratory of Electronic Design and Measurement for RF and Industrial Applications (EDM-Lab, http://www.dei.unibo.it/en/research/research-facilities/Labs/edm-lab) at DEI or on personal laptops after installing complimentary temporary licenses. The exercises will consist in circuit analysis and design examples with CAD tools. \n\nAssessment methods\nThe exam consists in two parts: 1. Theory and 2. CAD. The theory part of the exam consists in an oral interview. This is aimed at evaluating: 1. student's knowledge of subjects included in the course program; 2. how deep the student is able to develop the subjects; 3. their ability to plainly explain the subjects by using adequate technical language. Two subjects will be addressed during the interview. If requested, some time will be given before the interview for writing formulas, graphs, schemes, thought to be useful for subject exposition. The CAD part of the exam concerns the laboratory exercises. This is aimed at evaluating 1. the student's knowledge of the different tasks to be pursued with standard CAD tools for HF circuit analysis/design. 2. The abilities to autonomously carry out simple circuit simulation tasks and interpret the obtained results.\nTeaching tools\n- Theory notes and slides written by the teacher\n- Notes on laboratory exercises\nLinks to further information\nhttps://dei.unibo.it/en/research/research-groups/edm\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Alberto Santarelli\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Alberto Maria Angelotti"

Laboratory exercises will be carried out by using commercial CAD tools for the design of microwave and mm-wave circuits and they will be held either in the Laboratory of Electronic Design and Measurement for RF and Industrial Applications (EDM-Lab, http://www.dei.unibo.it/en/research/research-facilities/Labs/edm-lab) at DEI or on personal laptops after installing complimentary temporary licenses. The exercises will consist in circuit analysis and design examples with CAD tools. \n\nAssessment methods\nThe exam consists in two parts: 1. Theory and 2. CAD. The theory part of the exam consists in an oral interview. This is aimed at evaluating: 1. student's knowledge of subjects included in the course program; 2. how deep the student is able to develop the subjects; 3. their ability to plainly explain the subjects by using adequate technical language. Two subjects will be addressed during the interview. If requested, some time will be given before the interview for writing formulas, graphs, schemes, thought to be useful for subject exposition. The CAD part of the exam concerns the laboratory exercises. This is aimed at evaluating 1. the student's knowledge of the different tasks to be pursued with standard CAD tools for HF circuit analysis/design. 2. The abilities to autonomously carry out simple circuit simulation tasks and interpret the obtained results.\nTeaching tools\n- Theory notes and slides written by the teacher\n- Notes on laboratory exercises\nLinks to further information\nhttps://dei.unibo.it/en/research/research-groups/edm\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Alberto Santarelli\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Alberto Maria Angelotti"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course, students will: - understand the significance of urban environments through the transformations that occurred over time in relation to various political and institutional phases; - have a comparative view between Italian and European cities through specific examples; - be able to use sources such as aerial photos of urban settlements to identify the stages of their development from antiquity to the present; - recognize the reasons for the shaping of Europe's cultural heritage and in particular its historical urban landscape.\nCourse contents\nCultural Heritage offers a bridge between the past and the future by means of the present. The importance of cultural heritage to the economic and social development of urban areas is specifically important in Europe, where the population and the economy are increasingly concentrated in urban areas. The course investigates the formation of the concept of cultural heritage in historical perspective and European geographical spectrum. It also dwells on the cases of destruction of cultural heritage occurred throughout history. Starting from the shaping of urban landscapes through the ages, the course also addresses the heritage values of urban space, which are overall values derived from the integration of different components.\nReadings/Bibliography\nReconnecting the city: the historic urban landscape approach and the future of urban heritage, editors F.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe class tends to enhance the capacity of orientating in the process of defining the strategies for a distributed system and applying them in different related applications.   \nThe students face the principles and the main problems of distributed large systems and are exposed to some standard and widely solutions, by following the class and via individual work. At the end, students are expected to be able to know the properties of most diffused middleware and the evolutions one can expect from that technology, by mastering the properties for designing a real application: most well spread strategies are presented and discussed.\nCourse contents\nThe course covers several topics central in modern global data and processing infrastructures, such as Data Centers, MultiCloud Systems, Federation of resources, etc. typically supporting Industry 5.0 and Smart city applications, via the following basic concepts:\n\nAdvanced models for large distributed & cloud systems, from C/S to message exchange. Particular importance is given to the distinction and the implications of the two models,\n\nReplication, group and many-to-many communication, and systems for QoS\nMiddleware for development and management of large distributed & cloud systems\nCloud internal support and architectures: new semantics and trend derived from the Internet evolutions\n\nInfrastructures for global data storage and processing\nSpecific modern systems for big data processing and scalable global supports\n\nAll above issues are basic topics on which students must be aware of and very competent of, obtained by deep reflections and personal considerations.\nThe class explores the following topics:\nAdvanced models for large distributed & cloud systems\n\nClass Starting: general information and presentation of the Class (use cases)\nGoals, Basics, and Models: classifications, C/S vs. Message exchange, service and cloud models, parallelization models\nMiddleware & Cloud Models: definitions, categories, basic organization, and patterns for large distributed and cloud systems, Cloud internals design.\n\nReplication, group and many-to-many communication, and systems for QoS\n\nDifferent consistency degrees and impact on service properties (BASE and CAP)\nReplication: models, strategies and protocols\nCommunication and groups: models, protocols and algorithms\nSystems and protocols for QoS\nMulticast and MOM middleware\n\nMiddleware for large distributed & cloud systems\n\nCORBA: middleware and operating environment\nMOM: examples of very thin environments\nOpenStack: an example of a widely-diffused cloud IaaS\n\nNovel infrastructures for global data storage and processing\n\nGlobal data storage: solutions for non-traditional NoSQL data memorization (Cassandra and MongoDB)\nGlobal data processing: batching and streaming based big data processing (Map-Reduce, Spark, and Storm and S4) \nMain properties for effective design projects\n\nReadings/Bibliography\n G.

The slides on the Web site of the class are the main start for going into the topics. \nStudents are encouraged to discuss on topics and to develop ideas and opinions on the main current areas of debate. Students can go deep on selected areas they intend to focus on.\nWeb site of the course: AT THE MOMENT ONLY VIRTUALE, A NEW SITE WILL BE ON SOON.\nSome classes are hands-on on specific topics in the lab to go into the practical knowledge you need in some areas: the hands-on are given by industrial parties.\nStudents are referred to papers and articles to choose from and go deep individually into chosen topics.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Antonio Corradi"

Given that the course will be delivered in English, good reading, writing and listening English skills are expected\n \nThe measurement and management of organizational performance represent key ingredients of organizational success. By exploring connections between strategy, data, decisions and actions in this course we will focus on how to measure and manage performance in organizations.\nWe will first look at how to design performance measurement systems – balanced scorecards, control dashboard, strategy maps, etc. – as a key means to strategy implementation. We will then look at the different uses of performance measurement systems, not just as a way to monitor and control current activities, but rather as a way to stimulate organizational learning, reconfigure existing strategies and business models. Finally, we will focus on the measurement process by looking at different types of performance indicators, how to develop and implement them and how to translate data into information and knowledge useful for improving individual and organizational performance. \nThe course will be strongly rooted in organizational practice. We will: (i) explore cutting edge tools in order to design proper control systems and key performance indicators; (ii) apply recent developments in business analytics to different company data in order to translate row data into knowledge useful to effectively support decision making processes; (iii) listen to guest speakers from the industry that will bring real-life organizational “challenges” to the class.\nBy the end of the module students should be able to:\n\nCritically assess the design, implementation, use and review of management control and performance measurement systems.\nUnderstand the roles performance measurement and management play in organizations.\nLink performance management practices at inter-organizational, organizational and individual levels.\nApply the key principles and tools (e.g., strategy maps, performance indicators and targets) taught on the course to a wide range of organisations across all sectors.\nApply proper business analytics techniques in order to translate data into knowledge\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nBooks\nGray, D., Micheli, P. and Pavlov, A., (2014), Measurement madness – Recognising and avoiding the pitfalls of performance measurement, John Wiley & Sons.\nReadings\nA complete set of readings for the module is included in the pack.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nA successful learner from this course will know the principles, methods and tools necessary to manage design and construction processes, elements of planning, estimating, scheduling, bidding and contractual relationships, valuation of project cash flows, critical path method, survey of construction procedures, cost control and effectiveness, field supervision.\nCourse contents\nThe course provides a framework for understanding and analysing project management techniques as well as broader managerial issues. Lectures and readings provide an introduction to the following concepts: project initiation, planning and execution in the context of civil and construction engineering. Most of the topics presented during the course will also be analysed using case studies, problems and exercises.\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe following textbook is needed for a clear comprehension of the topics presented during the course: Project Management: A Managerial Approach, 9th Edition International Student Version | ISBN-13: 9781118945834, Meredith, Jack R.; Mantel, Samuel J.; Shafer, Scott M. 2015.\n\nTo order the book, students can contact the Pitagora Editrice bookstore - Via Saragozza 112 - 40135 Bologna - tel. 051/6446460, as well as access the HOEPLI website: http://www.hoepli.it/libro/project-management/9781118945834.html\n\nA copy of the book is also available in the ‘Gian Paolo Dore' Library (http://www.biblioteche.unibo.it/ingegneria/), School of Engineering, Via Risorgimento 2, Bologna.\n\nTeaching methods\nClass attendance\nStudents are encouraged to attend all lectures. The course is designed to stimulate class interaction and discussion. Most of the insights will emerge during class hours rather than as a result of a simple reading of the required teaching material. A deep understanding of cases and exercises can only be achieved through the class discussion and interaction between students and the instructor.\n\nExercises and Class participation\nSome sessions are dedicated to case studies and in-class exercises.

The design is examined in light of the interconnection with the protection of safety and environmental criteria of economic, financial and market regulations, with particular attention to the environmental aspects of the operations involved in mining and excavation. The fundamental aspects of design, management and control are discussed with emphasis, with examples and practical applications. Will be discussed the importance of planning procedures, organization and management processes and elementary actions. Particular attention is paid to the mining methods and techniques of exavation (culling mechanical, explosive, etc..). Methods for assessing the stability of mining excavations.\nProgram and content\nOre body evaluation, mineral exploration, ore reserve calculation, ore body ground conditions. Sampling, dilution and recovery. Open-pit or underground mining. Choosing an underground mining method (room and pillar mining, sublevel stoping, cut and fill mining, cemented fill mining, shrinkage, long wall mining, caving methods, sublevel caving, block caving mining, solution mining). .Guide lines for selecting a mining method.

The colloquium is addressed to evaluate critical and methodological skills gained by the student, who will be invited to discuss the topics covered during the course.\nThe oral examination, lasting about 30 minutes, is without the aid of notes or books.\nThe oral test consists normally of three questions on various topics. During the discussion are generally made more in-depth questions.\nThe student's ability to deal with the sources and bibliographical material, necessary to identify the useful information for the assessment of mining works, will be particularly appreciated. \nThe oral colloquium \nThe achievement of an organic vision of the issues addressed during the lessons, demonstrating mastery of expression and specific language, will be assessed with a mark of excellence. A more mechanical and/or mnemonic knowledge, synthesis and analysis of non-articulating and/or correct language but not always appropriate assessments, will lead to a discrete score; training gaps and/or inappropriate language, although in a context of a minimal knowledge of the material, will lead to votes that will not exceed the sufficiency. Training gaps, inappropriate language, lack of guidance within the reference materials offered during the course will be evaluated negatively.\n            \n            \n                Teaching tools\nPower Point presentations\nVideos\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Stefano Bonduà"

Fluent spoken and written english is a necessary pre-requisite: all lectures and tutorials will be in english.\nAssessment methods\nAchievements will be assessed by the means of a final exam. This is based on an analytical assessment of the \"expected learning outcomes\" described above. In order to properly assess such achievement the examination is composed of an oral exam.\nThe admission of the students to the final examination is constrained to the upload of the complete solution of the \"free\" exercise into the dedicated OneDrive folder \"MDM\", following the instructions provided by the teacher (see the slides of the course presentation for more details).\nTo participate to the lab programming exam, interested students have to register themselves by exploiting the usual UniBO Web application, called AlmaEsami.\nHigher grades will be awarded to students who demonstrate an organic understanding of the subject, a high ability for critical application, and a clear and concise presentation of the contents. To obtain a passing grade, students are required to at least demonstrate a knowledge of the key concepts of the subject, some ability for critical application, and a comprehensible use of technical language. A failing grade will be awarded if the student shows knowledge gaps in key-concepts of the subject, inappropriate use of language, and/or logic failures in the analysis of the subject.\nTeaching tools\nClassroom lessons will be held using slides, which will be integrated with the use of the blackboard for the development of exercises.\nLinks to further information\nhttp://www-db.disi.unibo.it/courses/MDM/\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Ilaria Bartolini"

Assignments are intended to assess the student's ability to solve a small-scale NLP task. Access to the written exam is possible only after submitting the assignments by the relevant cut-off date. There will be three cut-off dates:\n\n15 January 2025\n\n31 May 2025\n31 August 2025\n\nThe last cut-off date is also the deadline for submitting assignments for the 2024/25 academic year. Once submitted, assignments are valid for the whole academic year and grant access to all subsequent written exam sessions until the end of 2025.\n\nEach assignment is graded in a 0-6 scale, based on the timeliness, methodological soundness, quality and documentation of the submitted solution. Written exams are graded in a 0-18 scale, based on the correctness and comprehensiveness of the answers. Solutions to assignments or written exams that demonstrate an outstanding mastery of the course topics are awarded 0.5 extra points. \nAssignments submitted by the first cut-off date (15 January 2025) are awarded 0.5 bonus points. \nThe final grade is the sum of all the grades obtained with assignments and written exam. Half points are rounded up until 30. After 30 there is no rounding up. \"30 cum laude\" requires reaching 31 points. \n\n\nTeaching tools\nRelevant learning material including slides and notebooks will be made available via virtuale. All software resources required for this course are open-source and easy to obtain on the Internet.\nLinks to further information\nhttps://site.unibo.it/nlp/en\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Paolo Torroni"

Quarteroni, F. Saleri and P. Gervasio, Scientific Computing with Matlab and Octave (4th Edition), Springer, 2014.\n- A. Quarteroni, R. Sacco and F. Saleri, Numerical Mathematics (2nd Edition), Springer, 2007.\nFor the second part of the course:\n- A. Quarteroni, Numerical Models for Differential Problems (3rd Edition), Springer, 2017.\nTeaching methods\nTheoretical lectures supported by powerpoint presentations and use of blackboard, as well as exercises in the computer laboratory using the Matlab software. The laboratory exercises will be partly guided by the teacher, partly solved by the students (either individually or in groups). The results of the exercises will be analyzed during the lessons and (possibly) discussed by the students during the final oral exam.\nGiven the type of activity and teaching methods adopted, the attendance of this course requires the prior participation of all students in the training modules 1 and 2 on safety in the study places ( https://elearning-sicurezza.unibo.it/ ) in e-learning mode.\nAssessment methods\nThe exams for the two modules of the course are independent. Students are allowed to take them in different dates. The final grade will be computed as the (rounded-up) average of the two grades. To obtain a final passing grade, passing grades must be obtained in each of the two course parts. In each part, in order to achieve a passing grade, students are required to demonstrate a knowledge of the key concepts of the subjects, some ability for critical application, and a comprehensible use of technical language. A failing grade will be awarded if students show knowledge gaps in key-concepts of the subject, inappropriate use of language, and/or logic failures in the analysis of the subject.\nTwo midterm exams will take place, one at the end of the first part of the course (module 1), one at the end of the second part (module 2). Both exams will be written and consist of theoretical questions and exercises to be solved on the computer using Matlab (exam duration between 3 and 4 hours), and the passing and maximum grades for both exams will be 18 and 32 points, respectively. The sufficient marks (greater than or equal to 18) obtained by the students in the midterm exams will be valid for the exam session of January / February 2025.\nFor each of the two course parts, the final exam will be held in (mainly) oral form, with theoretical questions, discussion of the laboratory exercises carried out during the course and possible assignment/request for the solution of new exercises (exam duration between half an hour and 45 minutes, approximately).\nBoth the midterm and final exams aim to evaluate the knowledge of the key concepts and procedures discussed during the teaching modules as well as their critical understanding.\nTeaching tools\nSlides (and possibly notes) and exercises from the teacher, and other material in electronic format (Matlab source codes, etc.). The teaching material will be available on the University of Bologna e-learning platform ( https://virtuale.unibo.it/ ).\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Alessandro Lanza"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course the student is able to characterize the state of the art of industrial processes assisted by thermal (hot) plasmas for the production and treatment of high added value materials, as well as to analyze the most recent technologies that make use of non-equilibrium (cold) plasmas at atmospheric pressure, for applications in various sectors related to the energy, mechanical and biomedical industries. During the course, these technologies will be discussed in terms of design, economic sustainability and experimental analysis. The student also has knowledge of the main tools adopted in the field of intellectual property protection (patents and scientific articles) and has acquired methodologies for their systematic analysis. The student is also able to synthesize patents and scientific articles and contextualize them with respect to the state of the art of their industrial sector of reference.\nCourse contents\nAdvanced industrial applications are characterized by the common need for innovative treatments that modify the properties of different materials. Innovation in the industrial field is strictly related to the capability of exploiting research and transferring it to society using intellectual property protection systems (e.g. papers and patents). The course aims to understand the process of advancing in the industrial and technological fields using plasma applications as the primary domain. Plasma, an ionized gas capable of conducting heat and electricity and consisting of electrons, ions, neutrals, and radical species, has an extraordinary potential linked to its numerous active agents that give the technology the versatility required to adapt even to the most innovative and complex applications. Controlling plasma characteristics and optimizing them for specific applications requires physical and engineering skills and a strongly interdisciplinary problem-solving approach.\nThe course first module will provide students with the fundamentals of i) plasma physics and chemistry and ii) intellectual property protection. The second module of the course will consist of an in-depth examination of the entire redaction process of a scientific paper, on the model of a real-world research scenario. This includes bibliographic analysis to evaluate the state of the art, conducting experiments (with hands-on laboratory experience), data collection, data analysis, discussion, and conclusion.\nReadings/Bibliography\n\nLieberman, Lichtenberg, Principles of Plasma Discharges and Materials Processing, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course “Port transport operations” deals with port systems and their performances, which are the consequence of the interactions among the several elements – both operational and infrastructure – composing them. Particularly, starting from the harbour as node of an intermodal maritime and land transport network, the course provides the basic elements for planning port activities and for the management of freight flows at the infrastructure. The course wants to provide students with specific knowledge on the simulation, analysis and planning of port transport operations by modelling explicitly the transport elements.\nMore in details, the main educational goals are: \n1)\tAcquisition of specific knowledge to address the typical problems of transport engineering with a systemic approach, in particular for the quantitative estimation of the effects produced by designed solutions.\n2)\tAbility to model transport elements based on a system approach – by operating also in interdisciplinary working groups – with the use of mathematical models that could require a specific calibration for the faced problem.\n3)\tAbility to understand and identify advantages and applicability limits of the obtained solutions, with particular reference to the availability of resources and to the effects of the proposed solutions.\n4)\tAbility to:\n- organize the results of the studies carried out in technical papers (text and graphics);\n- operate at a professional level in design groups;\n- publicly present the results obtained.\n5)\tAbility to deal with transport engineering issues at a professional level and to update autonomously the acquired skills.\nCourse contents\nLearning outcomes\nThe students will be provided with basic knowledge on methodological, theoretical and empirical skills for planning, design, simulation and performance evaluation of ports and maritime transport, in the context of transport system science.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe main objective of the Course is to introduce and discuss the main aspects related to an internal combustion engine test cell, to allow the students to become familiar with such environment and its applications.\nAn introductory part will be provided to analyze the following topics:\n-\tMain theoretical aspects regarding homologation procedures and regulations;\n-\tMain engine sensors and actuators;\n-\tModern calibration methodologies such as Design Of Experiments;\n-\tMain experimental activities and facilities used during the engine and vehicle development process.\nDuring the course, students spend several hours in the test cell, conducting different types of tests (starting from standard power curves to calibration-oriented tests, or tests focused on combustion analysis, ...). The rest of the time is spent in the classroom/computer room, introducing the experimental activity and analyzing the data that have been acquired, with a calibration-oriented approach.\nCourse contents\n\n\nEngine and dynamometer installation. The main types of dynamometers and the corresponding criteria for choosing the right one.\nSensors and instrumentation to be used in a test cell environment.\nExhaust gas emissions measurement and control.\nHomologation procedures and regulations.\nSignal acquisition systems and signal post-processing systems. Data analysis and interpretation.\nEngine calibration. Design of Experiments methodology and test cell automation systems.\n\nThe class lectures will offer an introduction to several experimental test sessions that will be carried out in the engine test cell. During such experimental activity, calibration procedures will be demonstrated, and both nominal and faulty conditions will be tested on the engine, to analyze the engine control system performance and the main diagnostic functions implemented in the Engine Control Unit.\n            \n            \n                Readings/Bibliography\nHandouts concerning some elements of the program, exercises and examples, are available on AMS Campus. The following list presents the main publications that could be used by the students to deepen specific topics, or to complement their background on the subject.\n\n\"Introduction to modeling and control of internal combustion engine systems\", L. Guzzella, C. H. Onder, Springer-Verlag, 2004.\n “Engine Testing\", M. Plynt, A. Martyr, Ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, 2007.\n\nTeaching methods\nThe course is held in English. The theoretical aspects of engine testing are introduced during class lectures, while the experimental activity in the test cell should provide hands-on applications of engine-dynamometer control and measurement systems. Finally, Matlab-based sessions will introduce the students to data pre- and post-processing, with a calibration-oriented approach (possibly, each student will use a personal computer running Matlab during such sessions). The educational material is uploaded before each lecture on the University online platform.\n\nAttendance is strongly recommended for better learning of concepts and methodologies, but does not affect the final evaluation process.\nAs concerns the teaching methods of this course unit, all students must attend Module 1, 2 [https://www.unibo.it/en/services-and-opportunities/health-and-assistance/health-and-safety/online-course-on-health-and-safety-in-study-and-internship-areas] online, while Module 3 on health and safety is to be attended in class. Information about Module 3 attendance schedule is available on the website of your degree programme\n \nPLEASE NOTE THAT ALL THE STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO CARRY OUT TRAINING ON SAFETY BEFORE ATTENDING THE COURSE, IN A COMPULSORY AND PREVENTIVE MANNER.\nAssessment methods\nLearning assessment is finalized through a final oral examination, which takes place for about 60-90 minutes, answering a few questions in writing (diagrams, equations, diagrams, drawings, ...) and then discussing them with the instructor. The student can also produce a report about the analysis of experimental data acquired during test cell activity.\nThis test is intended to verify the student knowledge about the main subjects of the course. The final vote takes into account the ability to solve problems in the matters discussed during the lectures, and the acquisition of engineering methodologies for developing, testing and calibrating automotive powertrains.\nThe evaluation, expressed in thirtieths, will be higher the more the student is:\n\nautonomous in articulating answers to the questions and mathematical procedures for data pre- and post-processing;\nexhaustive in explaining the topics and the experimental approach to powertrain testing;\ncapable of synthesizing the most important parameters and relationships through graphs, sketches, and schematics.\n\nDuring the exam, students are not allowed to use the lecture notes or other material and they are required to have an identity document.\n            \n            \n                Teaching tools\nSlides and audio-visual supports will be used throughout the course.\nClass notes will be distributed to the students through the University online platform before each lecture.\nAlso, the experimental data and the scripts that will be acquired and developed during the test-cell and Matlab-based sessions will be made available to the students.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n                Office hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Nicolò Cavina"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe student acquires a thorough knowledge of automatic machines and robotic systems with regard to the functional architecture, the internal subsystems and components, with the general design criteria and their use.\nCourse contents\nThe course enables students to deepen the machine design knowledge acquired in previous examinations and contextualize it of Automatic Machines and Robots. In addition, the synthesis and application of machine design and construction principles and methods to concrete case studies arising from industrial problems are stimulated. \nThe knowledge and methodologies that are provided cover the following topics: \n\nmethodologies for Systematic Design (functional analysis, goal tree, morphological matrix, design variants and criteria for choosing design variants);\nmethods and techniques for scientific and technical literature analysis and an introduction to patent law;\nin-depth analysis of Automatic Machine Architectures (the main architectures of automatic machines are analyzed in detail, and interface and coordination problems of automatic machine lines are addressed; an in-depth analysis of buffers is provided, and in particular dynamic buffers for line balancing and, for product unit pitching are analyzed);\nprobabilistic analysis of productivity and OEE of automatic machines and automatic machine lines;\noverview of ancillary systems of automatic machines (magazines, feeding systems, rigid and virtual interconnection systems between automatic machines);\nKinetic-Elasto-Dynamic analysis methodologies for complex mechanisms and systems;\ntools for digital twin and virtual commissioning of mechanical, mechatronic and automatic machine devices;\nhints at the sustainability of automated machines (energy sustainability, environmental sustainability, second-life, footprint).\n\nThe teacher chooses industrial-derived design topics from year to year in consultation with technical managers of companies in the area. The topics are chosen in such a way as to fulfil the following cultural needs: \n\nstudy in detail functional problems related to automatic machine assemblies (e.g., product assembly, handling and transport, product processing) or concerning robots (e.g., handling, transport and assembly) \nstudy the problems of transportation and installation of automatic machines and robots\nanalyze issues related to cost and ergonomics of automatic machines and robots\ndesign for maintenance\n\napply machine construction concepts in a realistic and complex context (e.g., sizing of machine organs, assembly and assembly of mechanical components, choice of motors and sizing of connecting parts)\n            \n            \n                Readings/Bibliography\n1.

Keith Nisbett, Shigley’s Mechanical Engineering Design, McGraw-Hill, 2011\n\nTeaching methods\nTeaching is organised into two macro activities:\n\nThe first activity concerns the completion of methodological knowledge related to the Design and Construction of Automatic Machines;\nThe second activity concerns the development of concrete projects related to automatic machines or robotic systems.\n\nThe first activity is developed with classroom lectures. The second activity involves organising the class into groups whose numbers vary from 4 to 6 students per group. Due to its interactive nature, a part of the second activity will be developed through experimental distance learning.\nThe second activity is itself scheduled in two phases:\n\nin the first phase, the duration of which is about 1 month, groups of students are to study a line of automatic machines assigned by the lecturer (the purpose of the first phase is to put into practice the methodologies that are introduced in the course, to introduce the first problems inherent in the interfaces between automatic machines and power systems, and to develop the first soft-skills tools with particular regard to team-working)\nin the second phase, the duration of which is about 2 months, each group tackles a different project of industrial origin; the projects are assigned by the lecturer in the classroom, they are discussed in the classroom; each week each group prepares a power point presentation with which they expose, in the classroom, the state of progress and the technical problems to be tackled (each week one student from each group exposes, in 15-20 minutes, the presentation to the other students in the course and to the lecturer; during the weekly exposition, the lecturer intervenes punctually on the technical and organisational aspects of the project, also providing theoretical insights, when necessary, and giving indications on how to continue the project); every week the lecturer is available, outside of class time and together with his collaborators or together with other lecturers from the Mechanical or Automation Engineering degree courses, to meet with the student groups for punctual insights and to guide their work; every 7-15 days or so each group meets with the company contact person to discuss the progress of the project they have been assigned. This second part of the group's activity will be approached with experimental distance education. This approach will allow more effective student interaction with the lecturer and the company tutors.\n\nAssessment methods\nThe exam consists of a presentation and discussion of the industrial project and the delivery of a report about the project. The report is done following a guideline provided by the teacher.\nIn particular, each group presents the company project within a Workshop that the teacher organizes each year at about one month after the end of the lessons. The Workshop is attended by Professors of the degree programs in Mechanical Engineering and Automation Engineering, the technical referees of the companies and technicians from other companies are invited to participate to the event (the invitation channel is based on the distribution lists of ASTER and two associations of companies and industries, CNA and UNINDUSTRIA, which are both supporter of the initiative). The individual student performance is verified as each student has to expose a part of the project and must be available for questions and clarifications from the Examination Committee at the Workshop.\nEach group must prepare a global presentation of the project, based on a schema provided by the teacher, and each group has to prepare a structured technical report according to a schema provided by the teacher.\n            \n            \n                Teaching tools\n\nPowerPoint presentations\nAudiovisual\nCommercial software, such as ANSYS and Matlab, are used to analyze complex systems\n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Andrea Zucchelli"

In the slides both theoretical concepts and the solutions of simple exercises are reported. Interactivity is welcome during the classes: students are invited to ask questions to clarify doubts or if they want the teacher to repeat the explanations, as well as to answer the questions asked by the teacher. Furthermore, homework can be done by the students within specific deadlines.\nThe course is focused mainly on theory. Practical activities (e.g., use of software for consequence assessment) are offered in the Laboratory of Process Safety M – prof. A.Tugnoli).\nAssessment methods\nThe exam consists in a written proof, specifically a quiz with multiple choice answers, open questions, simple numerical exercises, questions with words to fit in, true or false questions,.... Sets of quizzes for each topic and an example of the written proof (with its solution) are available in the teaching material. More information on the written proof is reported in the teaching material and given by the teacher during the classes.\nIn order to avoid disapponting the teacher, it is strictly forbidden to sit the exam just \"trying\" to pass it. Students have to sit the exam only when their preparation has reached a sufficient level. In the teaching material there are lots of exercizes and quizzes on theory  to to allow students to evaluate if they are able to solve the exercizes and to answer the questions accurately and quickly.\n\nFor all those issues concerning the exam not explicitely mentioned in the webpage of the PSEM course and not reported in the teaching material, the indications of the Teaching Regulation (regolamento didattico) of UniBO are valid. In the unfortunate case that exams are online, the teacher will consider the possibility to introduce changes to the assessment methods. These changes will be valid for students sitting the exam online and for those sitting it in the classroom, so to avoid differences in the exam due to the mode the exam is taken.\nTeaching tools\n\nSlides explained during the classes\nAdditional teaching material \nBooks on the course contents\n\nVideos of some major accidents \n\nNumerical exercises\nQuizzes\nHomework\nExample of an exam proof\n\nAll the material mentioned above is made available on the Virtuale platform for 1 year (access is limited to the students having the course in their study plan). The teacher will NOT make available the audio/video recordings of the classes. The warm reccomandation to students is to directly follow all the classes, taking notes personally, writing the notes directly on the slides (which are made avaibable in advance), revising the slides and the notes after each class.\n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Sarah Bonvicini"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe main purpose of the course is to provide students with a thorough knowledge of the core concepts of tort law in the automotive industry issues not only from a national perspective but also from the perspective of the harmonization of European Union Law and the US legal system. The course aims at providing the student with a general knowledge of basic principles and concepts of European Union and US tort law and consumer protection law focused on the automotive industry issues. It also focuses on Corporate social responsibility and environmental and technological innovation issues that the automotive industry faces. Using the method of the economic analysis of law, the current UE and US legal system will be evaluated in the light of a pragmatic proposal to check that the basic liability law can still function properly in the light of rapid changes to some of the products that it covers. The attention will focuses on the new issues arising from highly automated vehicles. In this prospective it will be investigated the role of the precautionary principle governing the UE consumer protection law, and the risks development doctrine which can be seen as a limit to the manufacturer liability. The automotive litigation prospective also leads to focus the attention on class action and punitive damages which play a crucial role in the American legal system and are not still implemented in UE legal system. At the end of the course the student is expected to become familiar with the legal notions of producer, consumer, tort law, damage, product liability law and product safety law governing the automotive industry, in order to observe the problem of the automotive litigation in a globalized prospective.

At the end of each topic, a training exercise is proposed and solved in class. Such approach underlines the applied nature of this discipline and aims at teaching the solving methodology beyond concrete problems from the industrial practice.\nLectures may include team working and case studies discussion to promote active partecipation and interactions among the attendants.\nAssessment methods\nThe final exam lies on discussing a team-project based on developed Decision-support systems for manufacturing problems. Selfmade teams are made of 2-3 students. The project bases on an application written in Visual Basic and AMPL languages through the MS Excel Interface, and includes a paper document describing the rationale of the project, the model implemented, the input dataset, and the obtained results.\nPart of the final score results from the partecipation of attendants during class. \nPrevious computer science skills are not necessary, whilst proactivity and curiosity are broadly encouraged.\nBackgrounds of Production Management Theory (Requirements Planning, Inventory Management, JIT and Kan ban systems, push vs. pull policies) and vocabulary (BOM, Task, working cycles, Resource) are recommended.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Riccardo Accorsi"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course focuses on the development of entrepreneurial behaviours in a variety of settings. In particular, it presents the fundamentals of developing an effective business plan, teaching the basic principles of developing plans for the sales, marketing, product or service operations, financials and management of a new venture. It assumes some prior knowledge of the subject area and will equip students with much of the knowledge required to launch and manage a high potential new venture. The course allows students to deepdive in emerging digital technologies and learn how to turn technology into business. The activities are themed around major societal and industrial challenges in the global digital economy: Digital Cities, Digital Finance, Digital Industry, Digital Tech and Digital Wellbeing. Participants learn, e.g., how to develop different business models and are challenged by delivering their ideas.\nCourse contents\nThe course focuses on the development of entrepreneurial behaviours in a variety of settings. In particular, it presents the fundamentals of developing an effective business plan, teaching the basic principles of developing plans for the sales, marketing, product or service operations, financials and management of a new venture. It assumes some prior knowledge of the subject area and will equip students with much of the knowledge required to launch and manage a high potential new venture. \n\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe following textbook is needed for a clear comprehension of the topics presented during the course:\nPreparing Effective Business Plans: An entrepreneurial approach. Bruce Barringer, 2014, Pearson New International Edition, 1st Edition, ISBN-13: 978-1-292-03991-6 \n\nAlongside this textbook, a series of slides, case studies, problems and exercises will also be presented throughout the course. \nTeaching methods\nStudents are encouraged to attend all classes. The course is designed so to stimulate class interaction and discussion. Most of the insights will emerge during class hours rather than as a result of a simple reading of the required teaching material. A deep understanding of cases and exercises can only be achieved through the class discussion and interaction between students and the instructor.\n\nSome sessions are dedicated to case studies and in-class exercises. Students are invited to read carefully the content of each case/exercise in advance. This will help to better understand the theoretical concepts presented in class and to raise proper questions to successfully solve the case/exercise.\n\n\nAssessment methods\nAssessment will be based on a team coursework (up to 5 students per team).\n\nEach team will be assessed on:\ni. A final written business plan of 5,000 words plus exhibits (70% of the coursework)\nii. A 10-minute presentation (max 12 slides), followed by a 7-minute questions and answers (30% of the coursework)\n\n\nTeaching tools\nDuring the course some slides will be video projected in the classroom. They will be downloadable from the following website https://virtuale.unibo.it/. The material is password protected; both user name and passwords will be communicated to students during the first day of class. \n\nSome case studies, problems and exercises will also be presented throughout the course. Students will be able to download the texts from the same website. Solutions will be posted after the class. The material related to the week class will be posted on the website in advance. \n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Riccardo Fini\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of"

At the end of the project, the students have acquired a deep knowledge of the area and also capacity in understanding the global solution strategies. They have to apply the notions and skills acquired in the related class toward a design of a typical (limited) system with some predefined requirements and specific significant technology. The entire execution life cycle is stressed and some performance tests must be pursued.\nCourse contents\nThe choice of the topics to organize the project around is part of the final evaluation, the same as the technical report given in at the end and the presentation of it (slides for project presentation).\nThe areas to be chosen can be (other areas can be negotiated):\nMiddleware and service management\nCloud Computing\nScalable global Computing\nFederated Data Centers\nMulticloud\nServerless comnputing and FaaS\nIoT Cloud\nSustainable Infrastructures for Smart Environments\nSmart city Infrastructures\nIndustry 5.0 \n \nSome more detailed examples:\nObservability of Serverless computing\nServerless computing represents a novel Cloud Paradigm fostering a loss of control of computational resources for customers that can then focus on developing business logic. In this context, observability frameworks seek evolution in order to provide needed insights to customers to develop, deploy and optimize their services while leaving orchestration and management duties to cloud providers.\n\nEvent Mesh\n\nThe ever-increasing reliance on IT services of many businesses and realities shaping our society is rapidly increasing the number of IT services deployed opening many challenges for their orchestration and integration. Event mesh architectures aim to relieve this complexity by providing built-in security, observability, and management mechanisms of services deployed and asynchronous, uncoupled, and reliable communication among them.\n\nData Management and Data Mesh\nThe increasing pervasivity of devices and services continuously producing data, such as IoT and mobile devices, is opening many new possibilities and enabling a rapid evolution of our society. However, the intrinsic distribution of these data rises major challenges in data management including data ownership management, data availability, and data resiliency. In this context, the Data Mesh approach proposes both technical and organizational solutions supporting data management in highly distributed and heterogeneous scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nSee the corresponding reading list of Infrastructures for Cloud Computing and Big Data M\nTeaching methods\nThe student have to design, make the choices, deploy, and complete a project, to be negotiated with the teachers.\nFinally students have to provide a presentation ofthe project and a written report to the teacher in advance.\nAssessment methods\nThe student must present a written report about the project together with the project itself.\nAlso a presentation about the work done is to be prepared and is going to be discussed.\nTeaching tools\nStudents can choose any significant tool and system for project development and support.\nThe infrastructure of the support is of paramount importance, more than other minor programming development parts.\nLinks to further information\nhttp://Only-virtuale-available-now.A-new-site-will-appea-soon.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Antonio Corradi"

RT lab assignments submitted by 31 May 2025 will be granted 0.3 speed bonus points. The last cut-off date is also the deadline for submitting assignments for the 2024/25 academic year. Each assignment can only be submitted once and its grade is valid for the whole academic year. Assignments are not mandatory.\n\nThe overall grade is is the sum of all points gathered in the two modules, plus the grades of the assignments submitted by the date of the last written exam. The grade is officially recorded as soon as the student has passed the two written exams, unless requested otherwise by the student with a valid motivation. The following motivations are considered valid: (1) assignments are missing and will be delivered soon; (2) the student intends to sit either module's written exam once more. \nIt is possible to sit each module's written exam multiple times until the second and final positive evaluation. \"Positive\" evaluations are: 12+ points for Module 1, 6+ points for Module 2. Each grade overwrites the previous one in the same module and does not affect the grade of the other modules. Assignments can be submitted once per academic year.\n\nTeaching tools\nRelevant learning material will be made available via virtuale. Lecture slides will be made available before class. Annotated lecture slides and past exams may also be made available upon request. The virtuale web site will contain the description of lab activities and information about assignments. A limited number of copies of the adopted textbooks and other relevant textbooks are available at the library. The software used in the OS lab is open-source and freely available. The RT software is proprietary and licensed. The lab software, including the licensed software, can also be installed on the student's own computer. In this way, lab work can be carried out autonomously, without having to access the lab.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Paolo Torroni\n                    \n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Andrea Galassi"

On these bases, consistent, appropriate and type-specific methods\nto apply in defining valorization strategies and intervention models will be also provided, by\nstudying the few best-practices of effective valorization available at European scale.\nDIPARTIMENTO DI ARCHITETTURA\nALMA MATER STUDIORUM - UNIVERSITÀ DI BOLOGNA\nDIREZIONE E AMMINISTRAZIONE: VIALE DEL RISORGIMENTO 2 - 40136 BOLOGNA - ITALIA - TEL. +39 051 2093001\nPursuing these purposes, this teaching activity aims to offer theoretical reflection (on the\nconcept of reuse, sustainability, value, and valorization of these specific assets) and\ndisciplinary in-depth investigations (concerning Canon Law, Economics, History of\nArchitecture intertwined with History of the Church), together with examples and key case\nstudies.\nDue to the expected fast and wide process of dismission which will involve these assets in the\nnext years, planners, architects and designers will increasingly asked to work on the cultural\nheritage of religious origins, which peculiar nature needs for specific knowledge, approches\nand practices.\nAiming at this target, the present course acts as introductory to the management of\narchitectural religious heritage, to which a relevant share of cultural built assets is still\nbelonging in Europe, and particularly in Italy.\nCourse contents\nThis teaching proposal arises from data resulting from the most recent studies on religious cultural heritage: over the next ten years, 65% of religious communities will leave their historic homes producing an important and sudden gap in the management of churches, convents, monasteries, and movable cultural heritage.\nA vast set of wide and stratified buildings will need to be managed and aimed at new uses, having particular awareness of its meaning and particular cultural stratifications, whose visible traces are often protected by the Italian Superintendency for Arts and Cultural Heritage. \nThe ecclesiastical cultural heritage is constituted by a recognizable and peculiar set of goods, unique and not comparable to other sets of artifacts.\nIt is identified by:\n\nGoods which are characterized by a particular unit between movable and immovable assets;\nprivate goods for public use and of public affection, testifying of the religious culture of a community and a territory;\ngoods owned by legal entities whose main purpose is religious, and whose goals are deeply connected to ethical-moral objectives;\n    - goods that, as a result of the agreements of the Italian Government with the Holy See, are mixti fori, therefore subject both to the legislation of the State and that of the Church.\nThe first objective of the course is to educate professionals so that they could be able \n\nto understand the specific nature of these assets and know methodologically how to build correct paths to draft programs and projects for their valorization, \nto identify strategies and techniques type-specific. \n\nPursuing these purposes, this teaching activity aims to offer theoretical reflection (on the concept of reuse, sustainability, value, and valorization of these specific assets) and disciplinary in-depth investigations (concerning Canon Law, Economics, History of Architecture intertwined with History of the Church), together with examples and key case studies.\nSince planners, architects and designers will increasingly have the opportunity to work on the cultural heritage of religious origins, its specific nature deserves an introduction and in-depth study. For this purpose, therefore, the present course is given. It can be considered an introduction to the management of architectural ecclesiastical cultural heritage, for the preponderant presence of the Church’s assets in Italian and European territory. \nMoreover, due to the extraordinary and unique density that this set of goods has in our country, the promotion of its knowledge and the teaching of the main tools required for its preservation also corresponds to protecting the Italian landscape.\nThe fact that spaces of religious communities can be considered common goods and the fact that they are widespread in all of Europe and beyond, means that they can constitute an infrastructure for participatory labs in all of Europe with the involvement of municipalities and other institutions and the need and the urgency of involvement of all inhabitants. Intertwining the network of former monasteries with participatory action research labs means an extraordinary opportunity for the dissemination of laboratories of territorial democracy, where whole urban communities would be invited to collaborate on the definition of new compatible and sustainable uses for former monastic buildings.\nThere is indeed a strong bond between former monasteries and Participatory processes, since the space and places where democracy was first experimented and born, are now the places that require democracy to find a new social life, and where territorial democracy can then be taught. \nFurthermore, working upon the traces of religious communities unavoidably involves integrating inputs and scoping across different communities, intertwining scientific approaches which have to be considered at the same time despite their epistemological distance (theology and architecture; law and sociology, etc…). Intertwining approaches is the only way to understand the complexity of a phenomenon to provide it with a new interpretation, to build upon it a new narration that could be able to take the traces of the ancient role and meanings and shape a new and compatible use. \n  \nReadings/Bibliography\nCongregazione per gli Istituti di vita consacrata e le Società di vita apostolica, Economia a servizio del carisma e della missione: Boni dispensatores multiformis gratiae Dei (1 Petr. 4, 10).

An appreciation of the design of traffic elements on the road network and a rigorous detective approach to investigating road crash data will be developed. Participants will learn applied skills to find road crash data and analyse it to determine the nature and extent of road crash problems at any given site. An ability to translate road crash data into meaningful information, determine counter measure options from thorough analysis of information and prioritize and evaluate counter measure implementation programs will be cultivated. Students will become aware of key issues in road safety policy, techniques for accident analysis and prevention and road safety audit procedures.\nStarting with the Haddon Matrix-the \"Map\" of Traffic Safety, this course takes students through the many aspects of traffic safety engineering, including issues specific to Italy. Topics include where to find traffic safety data and how to use it; the various components of data (numbers, exposure, risk); aspects of traffic safety analysis (human factors, naturalistic driving studies, vehicle factors, occupant protection and risk compensation).\nThere will also be five sessions on issues related to global road safety, including the dimensions of the problem, the conflicts inherent in multi-modal transportation systems in rapidly motorizing societies, the risks posed to vulnerable road users, and international comparisons and programs.\nOther topics include the Highway Safety Manual, screening methods for identifying high collection concentrations and proactive improvements to traffic safety.\nThe course will examine principles of engineering and behavioral science relevant to preventing traffic collisions and subsequent injury. Human behavior, vehicle design, and roadway design will be considered as interacting approaches to preventing traffic crashes and injuries. Safety of vulnerable road users (primarily pedestrians and bicyclists) will be covered extensively.\nReadings/Bibliography\nHighway Design and Traffic Safety Engineering Handbook (1999)\nRuediger Lamm , Basil Psarianos , Theodor Mailaender\nMcgraw-Hill\nISBN-10: 0070382956\nISBN-13: 978-0070382954\nTeaching methods\nThe lectures will be supplemented by practical group exercises.\nExercises.\nThe exercises consist in the design and road safety analysis of an intersection\nAssessment methods\nThe final written exam will consist in 3 open question and 2 exercises on:\n- Road safety analysis of urban roads\n- Road data accident analysis\n \nTeaching tools\nWill be provided all the presentations of lectures and practical examples\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Andrea Simone"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nA successful learner from this course will gain (a) theoretical understanding of and (b) practical experience on key factors and main hydrological design variables of water management in anthropogenic landscapes, in the light of sustainable development and climate resilience. In particular, the course will address three main subjects: (1) smart water systems management, including energy recovery; (2) distributed hydropower generation; (3) sustainable urban drainage and urban flood-proofing.\nCourse contents\nThe course is structured into two modules that are taught in series; the first module has a stronger hydrological focus, while the second privileges technological solutions. The course focuses on the water cycle in human-impacted systems, as well as on its opportunities (resources, e.g., water allocation, distributed hydropower generation) and threats (hazards, e.g., urban flooding) by addressing the following subjects:\n\nBasics of hydrology and surface water management: measurement of main hydrological variables, hydrological balance and runoff production, assessment of surface water availability (flow-duration curves) and environmental flows (Module 1)\nSustainable stormwater management:  basic principles and examples of devices for sustainable urban drainage, rainwater harvesting systems (Module 1)\n\nDistributed hydropower production and energy recovery: plants layout, selection criteria for hydraulic turbines, hydroelectric production assessment, monitoring and control systems (Module 2)\nSmart water-demand monitoring in drinking-water supply and irrigation systems: available technologies, data analysis, engineering applications on demand-side water management (Module 2)\n\nPractical activities (on students' laptops and devices) and real-world examples from the city of Bologna will enable students to deepen their understanding of theoretical concepts.\nAll classes will be taught in English. It is, therefore, necessary to understand the English language to attend the course successfully and to be able to use the teaching material.\nReadings/Bibliography\nTeaching materials, papers, textbooks' chapters and sections from engineering manuals on the course topics will be provided via the official repository of the course on Virtuale.\nSuggested textbooks for further information:\n\nBrutsaert, Hydrology An introduction, Cambridge University Press\nBignami, Rosso, Sanfilippo, Flood Proofing in Urban Areas, Springer\nScozzari, Mounce, Han, Soldovieri, Solomatine (Editors), ICT for Smart Water Systems: Measurements and Data Science, Springer\nGulliver, Arndt, Hydropower engineering handbook, McGraw-Hill \n\nTeaching methods\nThe course consists of frontal lectures and practical activities (which will be developed under the Professors' supervision on students' laptops and devices); these latter are designed to apply theoretical concepts addressed during frontal lectures, and to prepare students to address the engineering problems presented during the course.\nAssessment methods\nThe learning assessment aims at verifying the achievement of learning objectives, i.e. to gain a theoretical understanding and practical experience on design variables, methods, and technologies for sustainable water management in anthropogenic landscapes.\nThe final exam, which may include a preliminary written test, mostly consists of an oral assessment focusing on:\n\ntheoretical topics covered during classes, and\na discussion on the report illustrating the practical exercises developed during the course.\n\nThis assessment consists of questions on the theoretical topics addressed during the course and includes a discussion concerning the report prepared by the candidate to present the practical activities carried out during the course; this discussion, stimulated by the teacher, is aimed at verifying in-depth the theoretical-practical level of the candidate's preparation on the different topics addressed during the exercises that were proposed during the course.\nCandidates who demonstrate knowledge and mastery of the fundamental concepts illustrated in the teaching will pass the exam, and a higher score will be given to those who demonstrate a thorough knowledge of all the contents provided in class, both from a theoretical and a practical viewpoint, and who will be able to illustrate these contents accurately and with correct technical language. \n(Exam dates are posted and accessible on Almaesami).\nTeaching tools\nThe theory illustrated during classes is supported by supervised practical activities on spreadsheets, or specific software. All practical activities will resort to licensed software that is accessible to UniBO Students (e.g. Microsoft Excel), or cross-platform Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) that can be installed on all major operating systems.\nHandouts on the topics covered in the course, exercises and their draft solutions are accessible for registered students and during the classes on Virtuale.\nAll classes are recorded and regularly made available in asynchronous mode on the dedicated resource Virtuale.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Attilio Castellarin\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Cristiana Bragalli"

The student will be invited to discuss the topics covered during the lessons and to move within the sources and bibliographical material in order to be able to identify in them the useful information that will enable to illustrate typical aspects of the course. The achievement of an organic vision of the issues addressed during the classes and their critical use, which demonstrate ownership of a mastery of expression and specific language, will be assessed with marks of excellence. Mechanical and / or mnemonic knowledge of matter, synthesis and analysis of non-articulating and / or correct language but not always appropriate will lead to discrete assessments; training gaps and / or inappropriate language - although in a context of minimal knowledge of the material - will lead to votes that will not exceed the sufficiency.

Additional readings are available upon request (but they are not mandatory).\nTeaching methods\nIn presence.\nThe course is organized in frontal lectures in which the main topic are discussed and followed by numerical and practical applications. At the end of each topic, a training exercise is proposed and solved in class. Such approach underlines the applied nature of this discipline and aims at teaching the solving methodology beyond concrete problems from the industrial practice.\nLectures may include team working and case studies discussion to promote active partecipation and interactions among the attendants.\nAssessment methods\nThe final exam consists of a team-project based on developed Decision-support systems for planning sustainable operations and production and distribution ecosystems. Selfmade teams are made of 2-3 students. The project requires developing tools written in Visual Basic (VBA) and AMPL aiding the design and planning of a sustainale supply chain system and addressing a case study assigned in class. Furthermore, a Report (word doc) describing the rationale of the Project, the model implemented, the input dataset, and the obtained results is mandatory. A well-shaped power point can support your discussion at the oral exam.\nPart of the final score may result from the partecipation of attendants during class. \nPrevious computer science skills are not necessary, but problem-solving approach, proactivity and curiosity are broadly encouraged.\nBackgrounds and fundamentals of Manufacturing Engineering (Requirements Planning, Inventory Management, Kan ban, Make-or-buy, BOM, Scheduling, Resource, Working Cycle, Unit Load), Logistics, Operations Research and Information Systems are recommended.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Riccardo Accorsi"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course is split in two modules, wheras the “Sustainable Transportation Engineering” module covers transport modelling and planning, while the “Urban road mobility design and maintenance” module focuses on the design of infrastructure necessary to improve the sustainability of transport. The main goals of this course is explain the theoretical foundations of methods that are necessary to understand, apply and evaluate the various scientific and technological approaches which potentially improve the sustainability of transportation. It presents examples of the aforementioned approaches such as infrastructure planning in favor of sustainable modes, alternative fuels and propulsion methods, innovative transport systems, and various taxation schemes to include external costs and attempts to change awareness. A main purpose is to make students capable to analyzing critically the potential of new approaches to sustainable transportation, rather than to give a complete coverage of all known methods proposed to date. Furthermore, the course intends to provide notions on the main tools used for a correct planning and planning of interventions on sustainable mobility in the urban environment. Finally, it intends to provide the fundamentals of road infrastructure management and the main maintenance techniques. The course will provide the bases of sustainable transportation systems and will also be an excellent starting point for students who intend to continue their studies in Civil Engineering in the “Sustainable mobility in urban areas” curriculum.\nCourse contents\n- Transport systems: definition of supply, demand and supply-demand interaction\n- Elements of transport supply: graphs, networks, cost functions\n- Demand elements: demand characteristics, approaches to demand estimation (from model, from surveys, from traffic flows).\n- The state of the transport system: concept of assignment, relevant elements for the simulation of the state of a transport system, static and dynamic modeling, congestion phenomena \n- Sustainable mobility. \n- Basic elements on freight transport.\n- Drafting, during the hours of exercise, of a project relating to the macrosimulation of flows on a portion of the urban network. For the drafting of the project, the students are gathered in groups: each group must prepare a paper which is subjected to revisions by a tutor.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThis course shortly introduces to wireless communications and the main applications of WSNs. It aims at describing those wireless technologies enabling the deployment of WSNs. Students use wireless devices and realize and test the performance of WSNs in realistic environments after being provided with a theoretical part discussing the impact of the radio environment, energy constraints and the basic elements of data aggregation techniques, laboratory activities.. At the end of the course students have a good knowledge about wireless sensor networks with a practical experience on how networks can be used in realistic environments.\nCourse contents\nThe course is divided into three parts: 1) Theoretical part; 2) Laboratory sessions; 3) Seminars on case studies.\nIn the first part (approx. 25 hours) lectures will be dedicated to present the WSN protocols to be used at the different layers, which are physical, medium access control (MAC), network and application layers. Main focus will be on MAC and network layer protocols, where some guidelines for the design will be given.\nIn the laboratory sessions (approx. 25 hours, starting from middle Oct.) is concerned students will have possibility to program MC1322 Freescale 802.15.4-compliant devices in order to setup a real WSN. On one hand, the laboratory activities will consist in the observation of the network behavior (e.g., network formation, data transmission, etc.) and measurement of some performance metrics (e.g., throughput and delays). On the other hand, students will have the opportunity to implement their own applications and measure performance metrics when considering different parameter settings.\nThe third part (approx. 10 hours) seminars, dealing with some research hot topics and applications, like smart city, smart buildings and smart manufacturing, will be presented.\nPrerequisites: it is requested students have knowledge of basic aspects of Telecommunications. In particular, basics concepts on spectrum analysis, modulations, thermal noise, performance of pass-band systems, basics of antennas and propagations in wireless medium.\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe following textbooks are highly recommended:\nTextbook 1: Josè A. Gutierrez, Edgar H. Callaway, Raymond L. Barrett, \"Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks - Enabling Wireless Sensors with IEEE 802.15.4\", Ed. IEEE. Send an email to Prof. Buratti to requested the book.\nTestbook 2: Shahin Farahani, \"ZigBee Wireless Networks and Transceivers\", 2008, Elsevier Ltd. Send an email to Prof. Buratti to requested the book.\nThe following textbooks could be useful to deepen:\nTextbook 3: R. Verdone, D. Dardari, G. Mazzini, A. Conti, \"Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks - Technologies, Analysis, Design\", Ed. Elsevier. Send an email to Prof. Buratti to requested the book.\nTextbook 4: C. Buratti, M. Martalò, R. Verdone, G. Ferrari, \"Distributed Processing, MAC, and Connectivity in Sensor Networks with Application to IEEE 802.15.4 Systems\". Ed. Springer, Germania, 2011. Send an email to Prof. Buratti to requested the book.\nSuggested book for students without background on telecommunications signal and systems: A. Bruce Carlson, \"Communication Systems: An Introduction to Signals and Noise in Electrical Communication\", ed. by Mcraw-Hill International Editions. The following Sections are those useful to follow the course: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3. Send an email to Prof. Buratti to requested the book.\nSlides of the course will be available on VIRTUALE.\nTeaching methods\nChalk and Talk - approx. 25 hours\nLab sessions (performed in groups of maximum 3 people) - approx. 25 hours\nProblem and Enquiry sessions - approx. 10 hours\nAssessment methods\n“On line” Mode. This is for students following the course and coming to the exam before end of February 2021. The exam will be composed of: 1) one open book (notes available) intermediate test, including exercises on PHY and MAC layers (result: passed/borderline/not passed); 2) oral exam. In case the result of the intermidiate test is borderline, the oral is composed of: i) one question on the intermidiate test (PHY and MAC layers); ii) one question on the second part of the course, that is network and application layers; iii) 10 minutes presentation (with power point slides) on the laboratory activity. In case the result of the intermediate test is passed, question i) above is skipped.\n“Off line” Mode. This is for the following students: 1) students not following the course; 2) students not giving the exam before end of February 2021; 3) students who will not pass the intermidiate test of the \"On line\" Mode. The exam will be composed of the same parts of the \"On line\" Mode, with the exception that the written exam will be NOT open book (notes not available).\nThe presentation of the lab activity could be based on: i) one of the activity performed in Lab1 during the course and the related measurement results OR ii) a project invented, devised and implemented by the students. The latter project could be performed in group of maximum 3 people. \nThe final mark will be based on the performance achieved during the oral exam. The mark at the oral is derived as follows: starting from 30 and decreasing at each wrong reply. Laude is considered only for students presenting projects (option ii above) for the lab activity. \nTeaching tools\nLaboratory: Freescale 802.15.4-compliant devices, sniffers, PCs.\nTheoretical part tools: Slides, books, scientific papers.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Chiara Buratti"
