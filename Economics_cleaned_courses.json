        "description":"Learning outcomes\nThe course introduces the student to the sociological-empirical analysis of societal phenomena, such as integration, acceleration, polarization, fragmentation and social action, such as conflict, protest, critique, social mobilization, and claims-making. The course introduces the students to a range of methodological approaches to the study of society\/social actors in interaction with politics, law, and the economy. The course enhances the student's capacity and skills to analyze society, social actors, and social problems by using sociological and interdisciplinary instruments.\nCourse contents\nIn the first part, the course provides an introduction to political sociology, its main sociological theories, concepts, and forms of analysis. Political sociology will be explored through main themes including power and authority, conflict in society, forms of mobilization, societal actors and civil society, and interaction with state (and international\/transnational) institutions as well as economic actors.\nIn the second part, the course will provide a specific (and critical) attention to forms of (innovative) data gathering, measurement, ranking, the usage of big data, and the potential downsides to the collection and uses of big data. The course will critically discuss formatting, codification, quantification, measurement, rankings, forms of surveillance and control, performance indicators and auditing.\nIn the third part, we will explore specific case-studies around four themes: Rule of law and democracy; Human rights, crime, surveillance, and justice; Market economy, the digital world.\n \n1. Introduction to Political Sociology (14 hrs)\nThe introduction of sociology and political sociology will discuss the sociologial approach to studying political and related (e.g. legal) phenomena. A core intention is to problematize concepts and phenomena we tend to take for granted, including in relatio to the following key theories and concepts:\npower, authority,\npolitical culture, legitimacy,\nthe state,\ncitizenship,\nsocietal integration and unity,\nconflict and polariztaion in society,\nsocietal acceleration,\nsocietal mobilization, actors, civil society, social movements, protest\n \n2. Political sociology, datafication, and data analysis (10 hrs)\nMuch of sociology, including political sociology, attempts to empirically (and critically) analyze social and political phenomena (such as those discussed in the first part) and engages with data-gathering as well as data analysis, forms of categorization, measurement and ranking of data. Data elaboration is frequently understood as a methodological matter, but may be equally critically observed as a distinctive set of practices that may significantly shape the capacities of political sociology to make claims and come up with meaningful research results.\n \n3. Observing sociological analysis in distinct case-studies (16 hrs)\na. Rule of law and democracy (6 hrs)\nThe rule of law is often considered in crisis, due to the rise of populist and authoritarian political forces, but also as a result of malgovernance (and the application of AI) more generally. A core way of addressing this crisis is to by means of monitoring the rule of law (on the basis of multi-dimensional indicators and measurements, such as in the Rule of Law index of the World Justice project). Quantitative technologies of measurement are evermore frequently used, but face a number of distinct problems, such as in-built bias, definitional problems, simplification, and reification.\n \nb. Human rights, crime, surveillance, and justice (6 hrs)\nIn the areas of international human rights and justice, evermore frequently digital technologies, AI, big data and open source investigation are being used to fight crime and injustice. Open source information opens possibilities of public participation in data gathering and analysis, and investigative journalism, but it also raises important questions for empirical sociology in terms of challenges to existing methods. The usage of digital means and bulk surveillance further create significant tensions with basic human rights, such as those to privacy, freedom of speech, and non-discrimination.\n \nc. Market economy, the digital world (4 hrs)\nBig data raises questions of who controls, owns, and has access to data infrastructures. A predominance of market actors, and specific countries such as the US and China, in controlling data and data systems may significantly forms of inequality, discrimination, and exclusion, while public monitoring and control might be largely absent. One example is the field of health, where on one hand the quality of care may be increasing and costs reduced, on the other social inquealities and access to health care may be declining.\nReadings\/Bibliography\nOuthwaite, W. and S.P.

Excerpts.\n \n \nAssessment methods\nThe examination consists in a midterm and a final exam.\n \nMidterm\nThe midterm exam consists in an exploratory assignment in which the student identifies a research problem (in the context of political sociology). The problem is to be subsequently related to key concepts, which are to be operationalized so they can be further studied, analyzed, and\/or measured. Finally, the student needs to indicate which method(-s) are best used to study the problem.\nThe student can choose from two formats:\n\nA written essay or blog of minimally 1500 words;\nA podcast of at least 5 minutes of discussion.\n\n\n \nFinal exam\nThe final exam consists in a written essay of minimally 3.000 words and a relevant and utilized bibliography of minimally 10 academic sources (5 need to come from the syllabus\/the Virtuale platform). The written essay needs to develop a small research project in political sociology, based on a research question and the identification of key concepts, and turning those key concepts into operationalized dimensions, which will then be applied in empirical research. \n The essay needs to be submitted not later than 1 week before the exam date. The paper will be evaluated on the basis of 5 criteria (introduction, main argument\/design, conclusions, references, and written language).\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Paulus Albertus Blokker"

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the class, the student has acquired knowledge of the most active and influential areas of research in behavioral economics. In particular, the student understands the empirical methodologies adopted, the theoretical implications of the findings, and their possible applications in economic environment with and without strategic interaction.\nCourse contents\nThe core theory used in economics rests on basic assumptions on individual selfishness, rationality and utility maximization. During the last three decades, these assumptions have been put into question by a growing stream of literature, broadly defined as “behavioral economics,” which aims at improving the descriptive accuracy of these assumptions, while maintaining the formal discipline of economic modeling. Based on field and experimental evidence on how individual behavior departs from the conventional theoretical predictions, behavioral economists have posited explanations for these departures, proposed extensions to the existing models and alternative theoretical approaches aimed at capturing them, and considered what are the possible practical implications of these findings.\nThis course aims at providing a critical overview of the most active and influential areas of research in this field, with a focus on the empirical methodologies adopted, on the theoretical implications of the findings, and on their possible applications (e.g., in the fields of health and labor economics, finance, marketing). It is divided into two main sections, the first dealing with individual choices, the second with strategic interaction. In the first part of the course we will discuss topics related to preferences over risky and uncertain outcomes, intertemporal choices, reference dependence and loss-aversion. In the second part of the course, we will deal with the literature concerning behavioral game theory, which uses the tools of standard game theory, but takes into consideration emotions, mistakes, limited foresight, and doubts about how smart others are.\nPrerequisite knowledge:\nMicroeconomics - Master level [https:\/\/www.unibo.it\/en\/teaching\/course-unit-catalogue\/course-unit\/2022\/350066] and Game Theory [https:\/\/www.unibo.it\/en\/teaching\/course-unit-catalogue\/course-unit\/2022\/350067]\n \nTopics\nPart 1\n\nAnomalies in decision-making\nDecision-making under risk\nReference dependence, loss aversion and endowment effect\nIntertemporal preferences\n\nPart 2\n\nbehavioral game theory\nsocial preferences\nmotivated beliefs\n\nPart 3\n\ncriticisms to behavioral economics\nconclusions\n\nReadings\/Bibliography\nDhami, Sanjit. \"The Foundations of Behavioral Economic Analysis.\" Oxford University Press, 2016.\nDellaVigna, Stefano. \"Psychology and Economics: Evidence from the Field.\" Journal of Economic Literature 47.2 (2009): 315-372.\nCamerer, Colin F., George Loewenstein, and Matthew Rabin, eds. Advances in behavioral economics. Princeton University Press, 2003.\nCamerer, Colin. Behavioral game theory: Experiments in strategic interaction. Princeton University Press, 2003.\nTeaching methods\nEach class will be devoted to the discussion of one core issue in behavioral economics. Before or during the classes, students will be invited to participate in a short on-line mock experiment, replicating the basic features of the studies that will be later presented. Results will be later analyzed and compared to those prevailing in the literature. The second part of the class will be dedicated to the theoretical models developed to account for the empirical findings, and the last part will deal with their policy implications and possible practical applications.\nAssessment methods\nStudents will be assessed based on four weakly problem-sets, and a final in-class exam.\nThe final examination aims at evaluating the achievement of the following goals:\n- knowledge of the most influential models of behavioral economics, in the realms of decision making under uncertainty, intertemporal decision making, behavioral game theory, and social preferences.\n- understanding of the empirical methodologies adopted in the articles surveyed during the course\n- understanding of the theoretical implications of the empirical findings, and their possible practical implications.\nThe problem sets will be published on the course' e-learning platform.\nIn the problem-sets (accounting for 5% of the mark each) students will have to comment or interpret graphs, figures and equations from the studies discussed in class, or briefly summarize the results. For the problem-sets teamwork is allowed but in the end each student will have to hand in his own answer, and “carbon-copied” works will be strongly penalized.\nThe final exam (80% of the mark) will last 2 hours, and will include a set of 6 questions of increasing complexity, covering both the mathematical\/analytical aspects of the models discussed in class and their interpretation.\nThe maximum possible score is 30 cum laude, in case all answers are correct, complete and formally rigorous.\nThe grade is graduated as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\nThe exam will be held in the computer lab. Questions will be randomly extracted from a predefined set, so the exam content will be different for each student. In case online exams will be envisaged by the University of Bologna, the structure of the written exam is the same. The exam will be run through Zoom and Exams Online (EOL). Detailed instructions on how to manage and hand in the online exam are available on the course page on the VIRTUALE platform.\nIn the final exam students may use calculators (but not other electronic devices), but they may not communicate with others, consult notes, books, or other written material. Any attempt to violate these rules will result in the student's exclusion from the exam.\nAt the end of the course, students have the opportunity to choose one paper at the frontier of the literature and briefly discuss it in a short presentation. The presentation is optional, and can lead to a marginal increase (or decrease) of the final grade.\nTeaching tools\nDuring the course, students will be involved in mock experiments, which should provide them with a more vivid idea of the issues to be examined later during the lecture, and active participation to the in-class discussion will be encouraged.\nParticipation in the mock experiments and the completion of the four problem sets is required. Attending classes is instead not compulsory, even though it is recommended.\nThe mock experiments will be computer-based and will require the use of a pc, tablet or smartphone connected to the internet.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Maria Bigoni"

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the class, the student has acquired knowledge of how behavioral economics is used to design more effective public policy in areas of taxation, education and labor markets. In particular, the student understands the neoclassical approach to public economics, the shortcomings of the neoclassical model in public economics and how behavioral economics may be applied. The student will understand the theoretical implications of behavioral welfare analysis, analyze and engage in public policy design.\nCourse contents\nThe standard neoclassical theory used in Public Economics and Public Policy rests on basic assumptions on individual selfishness, rationality and utility maximization. However, research at the intersection of Psychology and Economics (i.e., Behavioral Economics) challenges many of these underlying assumptions and aims to develop more descriptive models of individual and market behavior.\nThis course aims to study classic topics in Public Economics and Policy, including taxation, education and policy instruments but accounting for the shortcomings of the standard neoclassical model and supplementing the neoclassical treatment of these topics with insights from behavioral economics.\nWe will begin each topic of the course with an introduction to the neoclassical treatment of the topic. We will then explore the implications of the neoclassical model and ask what identify potential limitations of the assumptions of the standard model. For example, consider the question of whether taxing cigarettes can lead to higher welfare. The standard model posits that individuals make utility maximizing choices and thus the choice to smoke is optimal and imposing taxes leads to a deadweight loss. However, what if individuals are not utility maximizing and instead make errors in deciding whether or how much to smoke? If so, imposing a tax on cigarette consumption may serve to “correct” this error in decision-making and thereby improve consumer welfare. We will then identify a current public policy related to the topic and discuss how we might analyze its effectiveness.\nWe will cover both theoretical foundations in behavioral public economics and the design and testing of public policies.\nThe course will also highlight the link between theory and practice. We will do this with one or two guest lectures from individuals who span this divide between academia and \"real world\" policy design.\nA solid foundation in microeconomics and applied mircoeconometrics is a pre-requisite for attending the course.\nTopics include\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Behavioral Public Economics.\nTheory of Welfare.\nTheory of Policy interventions: Taxation & Nudges.\nHealth issues and policies.\nEnvironmental issues and policies.\nSavings & Retirement.\nEducation & Labor Market (e.g., minimum wage policies, discrimination)\n\nExperimental design, RCTs and Policy Evaluation.\n\nReadings\/Bibliography\nAll readings will be made available to students.

We will discuss the theoretical background of each topic which will then be followed by studying and discussing the seminal papers on the topic.\nEach class will have a lecture and discussion component.\nIn this class, teaching participates in the University's didactic innovation project by allocating up to 6 hours of online learning that will allow us to invite up to 2 guest speakers. This online component allows us to invite speakers from outside Bologna to provide practical insights at the intersection of behavioral economics and public policy.\nAssessment methods\nThere is one final assessment for this class which is in the form of a final oral presentation\/discussion of a paper during the final week of the course. Students will have several examples throughout the course of the type of presentation that is expected and will be given ample time to ask questions and work on their presentation. The aim of the presentation is to assess (1) students understanding of the course material and how it relates to the paper; and 2) students ability to synthesize and discuss the complex ideas and concepts.\nThe grade is graduated as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\nTeaching tools\nDedicated page on the VIRTUALE platform containing:\n\nNews and updated information.\nLectures slides.\nReferences to relevant articles published on scientific journals.\n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Stephanie Heger"

Furthermore, students will be able to acquire and grasp the basic notions about all the different types of firms, consortiums and lobbies, in order to assess and verify how these organizations, which are widespread in the Italian Economic scenario, could be profitably used for the practice of the economic activity (principles, structures and organizations). The International approach to the course Commercial Law sets the platform for a continuous comparative evaluation between Italian commercial law and Italian Industrial legislation versus the international directives on this very field (with a special focus on EU regulation on the subject), also considering international agreements, basic concepts of commercial law and industrial law, taking into careful consideration the antitrust legislation, unfair competition and unfair practices like dumping, misleading communication, the regulation of particularities and all creative activities, regulation of know-how and of technologies as well.\nCourse contents\n\nIntroduction to Commercial Law\nHistory of Corporate Law\nSeparate Legal Personality\nLimited Liability\nShares and Shareholder Rights\nThe General Meeting\nThe Board of Directors\nDirectors' Duties\nLegal Capital\nEU competition law policy and economics\nArticle 101(1)\nArticle 101(3)\nArticle 102\nMergers\nIntroduction to intellectual property law\nPatent law\nCopyright law\nTrademark law\n\nReadings\/Bibliography\nExam materials will be provided on virtuale.\nTeaching methods\nEach lecture will focus on a specific topic.

It focuses on approaches that conceptualise different models of capitalism and investigates the role of political actors, institutions and interest groups in shaping and transforming these models.\nThe course is structured around two key questions: To what extent do differences in institutional settings shape fundamentally different models of democratic capitalism? What is the role of political parties, institutions, firms and labour unions in determining the different arrangements we find in capitalist countries?\n\nThis course participates to the Teaching Experimentation Project of Bologna University. The maximum number of students attending the course is 50.\n\n\nThe course tackles the following United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGS): 1, 4, 5,8,9,10.\n\nLearning outcomes\n \nAt the end of the course students will be able to:\n\nAnalyse and compare national political economies\nCritically evaluate political economic inputs and outcomes\nUnderstand the institutional foundations of comparative advantage\nDesign a research project using the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) datasets available on the LIS website \nWrite a short paper on a topic agreed with the professor discussing the LIS results.\n\nCourse procedure\nThe course is organized in lectures and inverted classes, as detailed in the following program. Lectures (24 hours) aim to introduce students to the core tenets of the discipline. Inverted classes aim to provide occasions for in-depth discussions of class materials and exercises, as well as group presentations For the inverted classes, students will be divided into groups according to their preferences: two group(s) will do the inverted class in classroom (18 hours per group) Therefore, a total of 42 classroom hours are scheduled for each student. Students are required to carefully read the assigned material before the session and - in the case of inverted class - active participation through group presentations of existing scholarship, project preparation and case studies will also be expected. \n \n \nCourse evaluation\nStudents are encouraged to actively participate during the class and to hand in one question per group per week to stimulate discussions. During the inverted class, students are required to prepare short group presentations.\n \nEvaluation \nParticipation in class will count for 10% of the grade.\nPresentation will count for 25% of the grade.\nThe final assessment is a written paper using the Luxembourg Income Study datasets, the LIS graphic software DART, and will count for 65% of the grade (3000 words in total including abstract, bibliography, tables and graphs. Each table counts 250 words; each graph counts 250 words.

It focuses on approaches that conceptualise different models of capitalism and investigates the role of political actors, institutions and interest groups in shaping and transforming these models.\nThe course is structured around two key questions: To what extent do differences in institutional settings shape fundamentally different models of democratic capitalism? What is the role of political parties, institutions, firms and labour unions in determining the different arrangements we find in capitalist countries?\n\nThis course participates to the Teaching Experimentation Project of Bologna University.

Lectures (24 hours) aim to introduce students to the core tenets of the discipline. Inverted classes aim to provide occasions for in-depth discussions of class materials and exercises, as well as group presentations For the inverted classes, students will be divided into groups according to their preferences: two group(s) will do the inverted class in classroom (18 hours per group) Therefore, a total of 42 classroom hours are scheduled for each student. Students are required to carefully read the assigned material before the session and - in the case of inverted class - active participation through group presentations of existing scholarship, project preparation and case studies will also be expected. \n \n \nCourse evaluation\nStudents are encouraged to actively participate during the class and to hand in one question per group per week to stimulate discussions.

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nThis course aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the psychological, social, and cultural factors that influence consumers' decision-making processes. \nOverall, the objectives of the course are to equip students with the knowledge, skills, and analytical tools necessary to understand and influence consumer behavior in the marketplace effectively.\nCourse contents\nThis course provides an overview of the most relevant and updated research in consumer behavior. The course is structured in order to provide students with a mixture of theory and practical applications by following logically and chronologically the steps that consumers encounter in their decision-making processes, that is to say Need Recognition, Search, Evaluation of the Alternatives, Choice, Post-Choice Evaluations. It has four main goals:\n- To focus on the fundamental theoretical perspectives that allow to understand and measure how consumers make decisions;\n- To provide students with the necessary tools to measure and analyze the different phases of the consumer’s decision making process;\n- To stimulate the translation of the theoretical concepts into the managerial practice;\n- To encourage students to work in a team, and to present and discuss their ideas and results with the audience.\nReadings\/Bibliography\nThe course material consists of a collection of book chapters and scientific journal articles taken from different sources.\nThis “reading packet” is made available to students at Copisteria Asterisco (via Belle Arti, 31\/B; just close to Bigiavi Library and round the corner from Piazza Scaravilli) to ensure that the photocopies comply with the current regulation in terms of copyrights. In order to purchase it, you just need to stop by at Copisteria Asterisco and ask for the Reading Packet for the course of Consumer Behavior by professors Chiara Orsingher and Gabriele Pizzi. We are aware that this might be a little bit more expensive than normal photocopies, but the material provided is protected by copyright and we are committed to the complete legality of the distribution of the course material. Nonetheless, we have done our best to make the total cost of the reading packet absolutely comparable to, if not lower than, the most widespread university textbook available in bookshops.\nLecture notes\nAttending class, taking notes, and asking questions is the best way to learn. In class we will provide lots of examples that will be portrayed in the lecture notes. Furthermore, the course material is very detailed. For these reasons, the lecture notes that we are providing are not to be intended as a summary of the textbook and are not exhaustive for a sufficient preparation to the exam. Rather, the notes serve as an outline for the instructors for developing the concepts in each lecture. Lecture notes will be made available to students before each class on the IOL platform in .pdf format, so that students can bring a printed version of the slides to annotate them during class at their convenience.\n            \n\n            \n                Teaching methods\nInteractive lessons, Group Works, Exercises and Managerial Talks\nAssessment methods\nThough not compulsory, class attendance and participation in team-work assignments is strongly encouraged. Team-work assignments consist of:\na) One intermediate short team-work project at the end of the first term: students will be asked to collect and analyze data on consumers’ consumption goals, and to write a short report (max 15 Power Point slides). Groups will be randomly extracted to present and discuss their reports in class on the assignment due date.\nb) One final team-work project at the end of the second term: students will be asked to work in group on a project aimed at understanding and analyzing how consumers form their attitudes and intentions toward a given purchase situation and to present in class the results and the managerial consequences of their projects (max 15 Power Point slides).\nCourse evaluation will be different depending on the participation in team-work assignment, as detailed in the following:\nStudents participating in team-work assignments:\n70% final written exam\n30% team-work assignment\nStudents who do not participate in team-work assignments:\n\n100% final written exam\nFinal written exam\nStudents can attend a mid-term exam (not compulsory) during the teaching break at the end of the first sub-cycle, and then the second mid-term exam at the end of the course. The grades of the two mid-term exams will be averaged to compute the “final written exam” grade.\nBy School regulation, those who positively pass the first mid-term exam (i.e. grade greater or equal to 18), have the chance to take the second mid-term exam either in the January or February session. However, the second mid-term can be taken only once. Therefore, if a student does not pass the second mid-term exam (or opts for a re-take), s\/he can attend only total exams from that moment on.\nThe course material chapters on the topics discussed in the team-work assignments will be excluded from the exam program for those students who will participate in team-work assignments.\nThe overall grade is the arithmetic average of the results of the two checks.\n\nThe test assessment grid will be as follows:\n· <18 insufficient\n· 18-23 sufficient\n· 24-27 average\/good\n· 28-30 very good\n· 30 cum laude excellent\/outstanding\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Chiara Orsingher\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Gabriele Pizzi"

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nAt the completion of the course, students will be equipped with the fundamental concepts of financial management. This includes the ability to understand the firm’s governance, and to assess the impact of investing, financing, and risk management decisions on the firm’s market value, in a classical shareholder’s wealth maximization framework.\nCourse contents\nCorporate Finance (48144) will provide students with an overview of financial decision-making within a firm. The course focuses on decisions concerning how firms should raise funds in different forms, and how they should invest in real assets. The first part of the course will deal with investment decisions, that is how to value investment projects and firms, while the second part will consider how to finance these investments. The final part of the course will examine how investment and financing decisions are related. The course is aimed at providing students with a thorough understanding of how financial decisions can create, destroy, or transfer shareholder’s value.\nReadings\/Bibliography\nBrealey, R.A., Myers, S.C., Allen F., Edmans, A., 2023, Principles of Corporate Finance, 14\/e, McGraw-Hill.\nA compact version of the textbook, including only the chapters we will cover during the course, is available with the following ISBN: 9781307825572.

The structure of both tests is the same.\nEach test will include 8 multiple-choice questions (1 point each) and 4 exercises (2 points each) to be answered in 25 minutes. The midterm (final) will be based on the first (last) 10 class sessions. Both tests (i.e., midterm and final) will be in the form of a closed-book exam. The final grade of the course will be the sum of the grades of the two tests. The highest score is 16 in both the midterm and the final; therefore, the maximum overall grade is 32 (if greater than 30, it will be considered as 30 with honors).\nStudents may choose not to take the final exam in the above mentioned form (midterm and final), but rather a comprehensive exam at the end of the course. If so, the final exam will include 16 multiple-choice questions (1 point each) and 8 exercises (2 points each) to be answered in 50 minutes. The maximum grade is 32 (if greater than 30, it will be considered as 30 with honors).\nPlease note that to be admitted to the class tests (both the midterm and the final), students must register themselves via Almaesami.

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nThe aim of this course is to build the ability to analyze in a critical and professional way current social and economic issues that are relevant for public policy, using the tools of economic analysis and considering the political aspects involved. Through an in-depth discussion of selected current issues and applying, among the others, the conceptual tools developed during the first year of the program, students learn (i) how to structure an economic analysis of a particular public policy issue, (ii) how to perform the analysis, (iii) how to write a policy report or briefing, and (iv) how to summarize and present it both orally (without support) and in a presentation (with support), in order to convey effectively such analysis is a non-technical way to the policy maker or to public executives.\nCourse contents\n\nAnalysis and Discussion of Current Public Policy Issues: The selection of topics may change annually, depending on the evolving economic and political landscape and the emergence of new issues.\nPolicy Making Process Management: Regardless of the specific topics, students will develop the ability to manage the entire process: framing, implementing, and presenting a policy report or brief.\nWriting an Effective Policy Report\/Brief: Techniques and strategies for crafting clear and compelling policy documents.\nEffective Presentation of the Policy Report\/Brief: How to persuasively and professionally present the findings of the report\/brief.\nOral Briefing to a Policymaker: Skills for orally communicating with policymakers, summarizing, and conveying policy analysis clearly and concisely.\n\nReadings\/Bibliography\nThe readings and bibliography include a variety of non-academic and academic articles covering current social and economic issues relevant to public policy. Additionally, students will receive materials on using statistical analysis tools, such as Stata and Excel, as well as guidance on how to write effective policy reports. There will also be resources to help develop effective public speaking and presentation skills, ensuring students can professionally present their findings.\nTeaching methods\n\nLectures: In-depth presentations and discussions on relevant topics.\nHome Assignments: Exercises and tasks to reinforce learning outside of class.\nSimulations: Practical exercises mimicking real-world policy-making scenarios.\nVideos of Public Conferences: Viewing and analyzing recordings of public policy discussions and conferences.\nTutorials: Step-by-step guidance on specific skills and tools.\n\nStudents will initially analyze already published reports\/briefs to identify common aspects and main limitations.

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nGoal of this course is to allow the participants to get exposed to problems of business-to-business and business-to-consumer marketing from the seller's as well as from the buyer's perspective. \nThe course has both a methodological and an applied orientation, it introduces the concepts and methods of data analysis for marketing decisions and apply them to the main areas of marketing decision making. \nThe course relies on readings, case studies, computer lab exercises and team work assignments that help students understand how specific methods pay off in terms of better targeting and increased customer profitability. \nBy the end of the course, the students are expected to:\n- apply relevant concepts of business analysis to marketing problems, with specific emphasis on CRM decisions (Customer Lifetime Value estimation, customer satisfaction measurement and related managerial implications);\n- develop concepts and approaches underlying strategic and tactical decisions in business-to-business and business-to-consumer marketing;\n- be familiar with different types of real world data, and some advanced statistical techniques that can be applied to analyze customer-level data;\n- be trained on tools and skills needed to evaluate the appropriateness, performance, and value of different marketing models.\nCourse contents\nModule 1 (Gian Luca Marzocchi)\nIn mature and highly competitive markets the concept of customer satisfaction as a fundamental precursor of loyalty, profitability and customer value plays a central role in the implementation of successful business models. While finding new customers is vital, it is important to realize that retaining current customers is much less expensive than to finding new customers. It is therefore no surprise that a great deal of attention has been recently brought to the issue of designing and establishing formal systems able to bring the “voice of the customer” into the business\/marketing decision-making processes. The purpose of the course is to make participants understand and appreciate the relative strengths and weaknesses of a variety of customer value and customer satisfaction measurement approaches and instruments available today. A key element in this process is measuring customer satisfaction through market research. As such, the course will focus on the understanding and the actual implementation of the customer satisfaction measurement practices currently employed in business environment. The links existing between Customer Satisfaction scores, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) instruments and Customer Profitability results will be explored in depth, in order to create an understanding of how companies, service organizations and retail banks translate CS measurement in actual commercial strategies and decisions.\nAt the end of this course participants will be able to:\n• Understand the meaning of (and the relations between) customer satisfaction, CRM and loyalty\n• Evaluate the main techniques available to measure customer satisfaction\n• Design customer satisfaction measurement processes\n• Recognize how customer satisfaction impacts profitability\n• Identify the main issues involved in customer satisfaction (and dissatisfaction) management\nGeneral plan of class meetings:\nWeek 1. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Customer relationship management (CRM) – Measuring CLV\nWeek 2. Measuring Customer Satisfaction: theory and methods. Designing and implementing a CS survey.\nWeek 3. Designing and implementing a CS survey (cont'd)\nWeek 4. Measuring Customer Satisfaction: the Trim Grid approach.\nWeek 5. The Trim Grid at Work: cases and examples – CS project presentations\n \nModule 2 (Gabriele Pizzi)\nThis module provides a theoretical and methodological approach to customer value measurement. More specifically, the course will deal with the way managers can\na) MEASURE the value for the customer by assessing homogeneous segments of customers seeking similar benefits from the product\/service or exhibiting similar profiles;\nb) DELIVER value to the customer through distribution channels; and\nc) OBTAIN value from the customer through pricing and promotion strategies.\nThe module is very practical in nature and is aimed to provide students with rigorous methodological tools to analyze the different areas that contribute to creating value for the customer and to obtain value from the customer. Therefore, the theoretical foundations examined in class will be translated into the marketing practice by means of class exercises in the lab.\nCourse contents\n1) Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning\n2) Cluster analysis and customer segmentation\n3) Survey Preparation\n4) Multi-dimensional scaling and perceptual maps\n5) Pricing and Promotion Strategies\n6) Conjoint Analysis and pricing\/product decision\n7) Customer Satisfaction measurement and analysis\n8) Web Analytics\n \nReadings\/Bibliography\nModule 1 (Gian Luca Marzocchi)\nA reading package will be made available by the instructor at the beginning of the course\n \nModule 2 (Gabriele Pizzi)\nThe course is mainly practical in its nature. Therefore, the best way to learn is actively participate in class discussion and laboratory exercises. Lecture slides can be used as a tool to support learning in class. There are not mandatory readings for this course. However, students might make reference to the following two books aimed to deepening either the theoretical concepts or the methodological issues.\n1) Winer & Dhar – Pearson Ed. “Marketing Management (4th Edition)\n2) Mazzocchi, M. (2008). Statistics for marketing and consumer research. Sage.\n \nTeaching methods\nThe course teaching methods includes cases discussions, desk analyses of customer satisfaction data sets and group project work to allow participants to apply to real settings the concepts and techniques that have been analysed during the course.\n \nAssessment methods\nModule 1 (Gian Luca Marzocchi)\nFinal written exam plus assessment of team-based project works.\nMarks are intended on a numerical grade scale (0 to 30), being 18 to 30 the passing grade range. As for the grading policy, the course evaluation is made of: 40% group assignments and 60% final individual examination.\n\nThe final examination will consist of open-ended questions and\/or short analytical exercises concerning the topics discussed during the course.\n \nModule 2 (Gabriele Pizzi)\nThough not compulsory, participation in team-work assignments is strongly encouraged. Team-work assignments consist of:\nOne final team-work project: students will be asked to work in group on a project (i.e. analyzing an industry by segmenting customers and mapping the positioning of the main players in the industry) and to present in class the results and the managerial consequences of their project.\nCourse evaluation will be different depending on the eventual participation in team-work assignment, as detailed in the following:\n \nStudents participating in team-work assignments:\n70% final written exam\n30% team-work assignment\n \nStudents who do not participate in team-work assignments:\n\n100% final written exam\nThe final written exam for Customer Value Management (Module 2) will consist of the interpretation of a couple of SPSS outputs by proposing a) the conclusions that can be drawn from the data, and b) the managerial consequences of the findings reported on the outputs, backed by the theory studied in class.\n \nThe grades of the two modules will be averaged to compute the final grade of the complete Customer Value Management class.\n \nTeaching tools\nSlides, PC, statistical and IT tools\n \nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Gian Luca Marzocchi\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Gabriele Pizzi"

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nIn this course the student learns the basic econometric tools useful for a proper empirical analysis of economic phenomena. \nAt the end of the course the student is able to: \n- Critically evaluate the application and empirical economic literature; \n- Apply the basic econometric methods to conduct empirical analysis (forecasts and estimates) in the economic field with the use of an appropriate econometric software.\nCourse contents\nTopics discussed during the first part of the course (first subcycle):\n1. Introduction to econometrics\n2. Review of probability and statistics\n3. The simple linear regression model\n3.1 Least squares estimation: definition and properties\n3.2 Interval estimation and hypothesis testing\n3.3 Forecasting, goodness of fit and specification issues\n4. The multiple linear regression model\n4.1 Nonlinear in variables models and the use of interaction variables\n4.2 Joint test of linear constraints on the parameters\n4.3 Specification analysis\n4.4 Use of nonsample information and collinearity\nTopics discussed during the second part of the course (second subcycle):\n5. Heteroskedasticity\n6. Dynamic models and autocorrelation\n7. Endogeneity and instrumental variables\n8. Panel data models\n8.1 Fixed effects\n8.2 Random effects\n8.3 Hausman-Taylor estimator\nReadings\/Bibliography\nJ. H. Stock, M. W. Watson, \"Introduction to Econometrics\" (4th global edition), Pearson 2020.\nThe slides used during classes, sketches of training sessions, exercises solutions and mock exams will be made available for download from Virtuale.\nTeaching methods\nLecture and individual practice in the class.\nFor each topic we will first introduce the relevant theory, and then move as soon as possible to its empirical application. Special emphasis will be placed on the economic interpretation of the results. Attending classes is important especially to learn the empirical topics of the course. At the end of each lecture an exercise will be assigned to students and its solution will be discussed at the start of the following lecture. These \"at home\" exercises do not concur to the final grade.\nAssessment methods\nThe exam, which is partly theoretical and partly empirical, tests the ability to apply the methods learnt to simulated or real data, using the R software, the acquired knowledge of the theoretical concepts and the ability to interpret estimation results in the light of the underlying theory.\nBoth the midterms and the total are written. It lasts one hour and it is composed of two distinct sections.\n\nThe first one is mainly theoretical, and it contains 5 multiple choice questions. The second one is mainly empirical, and it contains 11 questions whose answers shoud be computed using R and knowledge of the empirical analysis discussed during classes. Whatever the section, each correct answer yields two points; no penalty is applied to wrong answers. The final mark is the total number of point obtained in the two sections.\nDuring the exam it is forbidden to consult notes, slides, books, pocket calculators and any other electronic devices. The purpose of the exam is to ascertain that students acquired the knowledge required to correctly specify, estimate and test the econometric models discussed during the lectures and possess the ability to properly interpret the results provided by these procedures.\nStudents can reject the grade obtained at the exam once. To this end, he\/she must email a request to the instructor within the date set for registration. The instructor will confirm reception of the request within the same date.\nRejection is intended with respect to the whole exam, whose grade is the average of the grades obtained in the two mid-terms. If the grade is rejected, the student must retake the full exam (consisting of both parts). The only grade that can be rejected without any communication from the student is the one of the first mid-term: in this case the student can either take the second mid-term or sit the full exam (thus losing the grade obtained in the first mid-term).\nStudents sitting the first mid-term can take the second mid-term on the first examination date set for the full exam, right at the end of the course, or on the following call. A student can sit the second mid-term only once; if he\/she fails or rejects the grade obtained, he\/she will have to resit the full exam and will lose the grade obtained in the first mid-term.\nIn case online exams will be envisaged by the University of Bologna, the structure of the written exam is the same. The exam will be run through Zoom and Exams Online (EOL). Detailed instructions on how to manage and hand in the online exam will be available on the course page on the VIRTUALE platform.\nThe maximum possible score is 30 cum laude, in case all anwers are correct, complete and formally rigorous.\nThe grade is graduated as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\nTeaching tools\nDedicated page on the VIRTUALE platform containing:\n\nNews and updated information\nLectures slides\nR lab material\n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Sergio Pastorello"

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nThe course provides an elementary but comprehensive introduction to the practice of econometrics for cross-sectional data, useful to correctly interpret estimates and develop simple empirical projects. By the end of the course the student will have adequate knowledge of linear and some non linear (logit, probit) regression models for the analysis of cross-sectional data and he\/she will be able to understand under what conditions linear regression model estimates have a causal interpretation. All regression models will be illustrated starting from the discussion of a recent micro-economic application. Examples will be analyzed in detail through lab-session, where students will be able to practice at the computer with real data and learn the basic skills to perform empirical work using the software available through the campus licence or freely availale. Students will develop data analysis competencies and critical thinking. At the end of the course we will devote some time to discuss under which assumptions one draw conclusions on the causal relationship between phenomena, using regression results (eg does education causes increases in earnings? does breastfeeding increase children IQ? does media bias affect voting behaviour?).\nCourse contents\n1a.

(https:\/\/kahoot.com\/). Students do not need to install the software ahead but need to have a device (mobile phone or laptop) who can access internet during the lectures in which this approach will be implemented.\nIn addition, peer education requires a great deal of investment from students as students have to read the textbook before coming to class.\nAs concerns the teaching methods of this course unit, all students must attend Module 1, 2 [https:\/\/www.unibo.it\/en\/services-and-opportunities\/health-and-assistance\/health-and-safety\/online-course-on-health-and-safety-in-study-and-internship-areas] on Health and Safety online\nAssessment methods\n1 hour written exam (30 points final exam or 15+15 intermediate exams) with open and multiple choice questions on theory and pratcical exercises using STATA. The exam will be held in the computer lab. Each exam will have a minum of 3 and a maximum of 10 questions. Points awarderd for corrected answers to each question will be available.\nStudents can either take the exam at the end of the course on the full program or take two intermediate exams. If the student fails on at least one of the intermediate exams, he will have to take the full exam: there are no re-takes for intermediate exams\nThe final exam mark is the sum of the two intermediate exams' marks. The final mark ranges between 0 and 32; each intermediate exam is worth between 0 and 16 points (the range of points awarded for each question will be updated accordingly). To pass the final exam, both intermediate exam marks should be higher than 7 and their sum should be at least 18: eg. one fails, if his score is 7+7=14; one passes if the score is 7+11=18.\nSince there are no re-takes for the intermediate exams, a student who fails the first or second intermediate exam, will have to take the full final exam.\nStudents with final number of points 32 qualify for getting the mark 30 cum laude. 30 cum laude could be awarded to students scoring between 30 and 32 points.\nAccording to the indications of the council of the School of Economics and Management, the indications on the graduation of the grade are reported.\n• <18 insufficient\n• 18-23 sufficient\n• 24-27 good\n• 28-30 excellent\n• 30 cum laude excellent with praise (honors)\nIn the event of substantial restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the assessment methods might have to be adapted to online exam session and might be reviewed accordingly, giving prior notice to students.

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course, students know the most appropriate estimating techniques for dynamic panel data models, both microeconomic (large and with more than one cross-sectional dimension) and macroeconomic (over a long time span). Specifically, they can: - critically understand theoretical and applied aspects of the vast literature based on dynamic panel data models; - apply dynamic panel data models techniques to their own analyses by programming specific routines using the STATA software.\nCourse contents\nPanel data, be it longitudinal data, cross-sectional time-series data (CSTS) and multilevel data, permeate empirical research in many fields of behavioural sciences, from economics to psychology. The aim of the course is to provide a methodological and applied overview of panel data econometrics.\nTopics covered in this course:\n\n1) strengths and weaknesses of various estimation methods: POLS, FE, FD, BE, RE; \n2) double endogeneity and CRE; \n3) dynamic models and the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM).\n4) non-stationarity and unit roots; common correlated effects; slope heterogeneity (MG and PMG, meta analysis).\n\nClearly there are necessary prerequisities, specifically for Erasmus students:\n1.

Of course, attending and participating the lectures is highly recommended.\n\nAssessment methods\nDuring the course, you will be given an assignment to do at home (alone or in a group of up to three people) and to post on VIRTUALE at the deadline set by the lecturer. This is a research question relevant to the topics seen in class (the lecturer will provide datasets and questions), to be developed empirically, giving reasons. The homework contributes 30% to the overall assessment.\nThe final exam, compulsory and subject to registration on AlmaEsami, contributes the remaining 70%. It consists of an individual presentation in the classroom (maximum time 15 minutes) of an empirical analysis conducted on panel data. You can decide together with me which topic you would like to explore in more depth or agree that I will assign you a research question. The assessment focuses on your ability to analyse the topic in a theoretical and applied manner.\nThe overall grading scale is:\n30 cum laude: impeccable work\n28-30: excellent work, which demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive knowledge of the topic, as well as excellent comprehension and analytical skills.\n24-27: good work that denotes an appreciable degree of knowledge of the subject.\n18-23: there is disorder, with theoretical and methodological inaccuracies.\n<18: failure of the test\nTeaching tools\nTheoretical lectures combined with empirical work sessions\nHelp in programming the software\nDiscussion of results and critical evaluation of the empirical literature\nCapacity to select the best method for estimating different types of panel models.\nVirtual room on TEAMS (just in case you cannot attend physically one of the lessons) for direct chat communication\n            \n            \n            \n            \n                Office hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Maria Elena Bontempi"

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nThe course will offer students a multidimensional perspective on the dynamic links between human societies and the environment, using insights from environmental, resource and ecological economics. After presenting the historical background of the discipline, the course will provide a broad overview of how economic theory conceptualises the problems of optimal pollution control and the efficient use of exhaustible and renewable natural resources. Several key sub-fields of environmental economics will be analysed and discussed, including the valuation of environmental goods, the measurement of sustainability, the links between economic growth and environmental degradation, the role of technological innovation as well as the behavioural aspects of environmental protection. Climate economic modelling will be the main applied focus of the course.  At the end of the course, students will have a comprehensive understanding of the most relevant research areas in environmental and resource economics.\nCourse contents\nThe course takes place in the first half of the autumn semester. It will cover the following topics:\n\nWeak and strong sustainability; environmental and ecological economics\nEconomic growth and the environment\nMeasures of sustainability\nStatic and dynamic efficiency\nCost-benefit analysis\nDepletable resource economics\n\n\nRenewable resource economics\nClimate change economics\nEnvironmental policy\nInternational environmental agreements\n\nWhile the course will touch upon policy strategies, a dedicated course on ‘Environmental Economic Policy’ is available to interested students\nReadings\/Bibliography\nThe recommended textbook for this course is:\n\nPerman, R., Y.

At the end of the course, students will be able to make their own model-based ex ante forecasts, and to evaluate the ex post forecasting ability of the professional forecasters activity.\nCourse contents\nAn introductory picture of forecasting in business and economics (FBE): governing many trade-offs\nBridge models as static\/dynamic single-equation models: problems and advantages (GM, 1-3, 5\nMidas models: relationships at mixed frequency of observations (GM, 12)\nFactor models vs regressors’ selection algorithms: the curse of dimensionality (GM, 13)\nBayesian estimates to tackle the curse of dimensionality: from VAR to BVAR models (GM, 6-8)\nMacroeconometric models and the amount of economic theory: RBC, DSGE and Hybrid-VECM\nForecast evaluation and combination for better predictions (GM, 4)\nnote: “GM, #” refers to single chapters of FBE course textbook, see below\nReadings\/Bibliography\nBasic textbook:\nEric Ghysels and Massimiliano Marcellino, Applied Economic Forecasting using Time Series Methods, Oxford University Press, 2018 (referred to as GM).\nPlease note that chapters 1-3, 5, and 7 (excluding empirical examples) of GM must be read in advance (i.e., before the beginning of FBE lectures), as they review the main content of the Time Series Econometrics course from the first year.\nFurther readings will be provided during the lectures.\nTeaching methods\nDuring each of the 5 weeks of the FBE course, there will be 6 hours of traditional in-person teaching using a blackboard and slides.\nAdditionally, scheduled online meetings will be held every week to illustrate EViews applications and to assess your home assignments.\nAssessment methods\nA number of home assignments will be given during FBE. They must be completed weekly and will account for 50% of the grade. This approach ensures students are engaged throughout FBE and encourages active participation in all in-person lectures, as well as a number of online meetings.\nIn addition, there will be a final in-person exam, which accounts for the remaining 50% of FBE grade.\nStudents who do not attend all FBE lectures and online meetings are required to take a comprehensive written exam in person, covering all FBE topics.\nGrades of FBE assessment: <18: not sufficient; 18-23: sufficient; 24-27: good; 28-30: very good; 30 e lode:outstanding.\nNote for Erasmus (International) Students:\nSince FBE is closely related to the content of the first-year \"Time Series Econometrics\" (TSE) course, selecting FBE without a full understanding of TSE may result in problems and extra work due to the integration of both courses.\nTeaching tools\nOnline meetings and home assignments will utilize the EViews econometric software. The EViews 12 license is available in two ways:\n(1) Purchase the University Edition online for $49.95, or\n(2) Use the free EViews Student Version Lite.\nBoth options are illustrated at this link. \nAlternatively, home assignments can be completed using R, but R online tutorials will be not provided.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Roberto Golinelli"

The course will introduce studnets to studying organisational issues related to incentives and agency theory.\nCourse contents\nLearning Outcomes\nAt the end of the course students should be able to:\n- describe the basic questions, models, and methods asked in industrial organization\n- discuss the basic framework of competition policy, as applied to market definition, merger assessment, and anti-competitive behaviors\n- analyze market structure, using concentration measures and assessment of an industry’s structural factors\n- use basic game theoretic tools to analyze strategic situations\n- apply standard economic models to understand firm decisions and strate\nPrerequisites\nThe course assumes that students are familiar with basic microeconomic models (perfect competition, monopoly) and are comfortable with using algebra and basic calculus (e.g. linear systems of equations, derivatives and partial derivatives, optimization problems in one and two variables).\nCourse Contents\nThe course is taught in two modules. Module 1 focuses on providing students with the analytical tools used in Industrial Organization. Module 2 uses the tools taught in the first module to analyze industrial structure and firm strategy, through the lens of competition policy.\nThe topics covered in each module will include the following.\nModule 1: Theoretical Tools for Industrial Organization\n1. Review of consumer theory and producer theory\n2. Perfect competition and efficiency\n3. Monopoly and market power\n4. Game theory: games in normal form, Nash Equilibrium\n5. Theories of Oligopoly: Bertrand and Cournot competition\n6. Game theory: games in extensive form, Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium, games in repeated form\n7. Theories of Oligopoly: collusion when interactions are repeated\nModule 2: Market Power in Practice\n8. Competition policy and regulation\n9. Measuring market structure and market Power\n10. Horizontal and vertical Mergers\n11. Market foreclosure and anticompetitive behavior\n12. Pricing strategies: Predatory pricing, price discrimination, and non-linear pricing\n13. Non-pricing firm strategy: Branding and product differentiation\nReadings\/Bibliography\nThe main text book for the course will be:\nL. Cabral, Introduction to Industrial Organization, second edition, MIT Press, 2017.\nAdditional materials may be drawn on for specific parts of the course. These will be announced in class.\nTeaching methods\nStandard frontal teaching. Students with disabilities or specific learning disabilities (DSA) are expected to request appropriate accommodations as early as possible during the class so adjustments can be made accordingly.\nAssessment methods\nThe course will be evaluated using written exams, conducted in presence. They will last approximately 60-90 minutes and will include a combination of exercises and other questions.\nIn order to pass the written exam, students have two possibilities:\n1. Take only the general exam in December, January, or September.\n2. Take the partial midterm exam at the end of Module 1 and a second partial midterm exam in December or January (of the same academic year).\nEach module will be graded separately, out of 16. The total score for the course will be the sum of the scores received for each module. Students must pass both modules (i.e., receive a minimum score of 9 in each) to pass the course. In addition to the written exam, there may be an option to receive points through class engagement.\nStudents may only enrol in a midterm exam if they have not enrolled in any previous exam in this course (either the midterm or the final). Students can reject their final grade once. To reject their grade, they must complete the online form provided by the instructor after the exam, within the relevant time period (any such requests submitted by email may be ignored unless otherwise stated).\nThe grade is scaled as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\nTeaching tools\nTextbook, slides and exercises.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Jonathan Neil Chapman\n                    \n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Annalisa Loviglio"

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the module, students:\n-\tlearn the causes and consequences of international trade, the effects of trade policies, the causes of international factor movements, the role of foreign direct investements in multinational operations and the role of the World Trade Organization.\n-\thave acquired an empirical and theoretical understanding of the complex issues raised by the economic interdependence of nations and will be able to analyze them in a systematic way.\nCourse contents\nThis course gives an overview of the causes and consequences of international trade, as well as the institutional context in which trade (and factor movements) take place in the modern economy. Topics in the general area of trade theory and commercial policy include: determinants of trade flows, effects of trade on economic welfare and income distribution, efficiency and redistributive effects of tariff and nontariff protection of domestic industries, the theory of preferential trading agreements. Institutional topics include: the history of the global trading system, multilateral trade negotiations and the GATT\/WTO system, empirical approaches to capturing trade patterns, and the regionalism movement. More specifically, the first part of the course will focus on theoretical frameworks designed to understand the drivers and implications of international trade(including the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage and the Heckscher-Ohlin model) and briefly review the empirical applications of these models. The second part of the course will cover distributional consequences of trade policy instruments, arguments for trade protection, and the organization of the world trade system.\nSome knowledge of the basic principles of microeconomics can be useful for this course, together with an understanding of high-school linear algebra and graph analysis using Cartesian axes. More advanced topics in microeconomics will be introduced throughout the course.\n \nCourse Outline \n1. Introduction to the World of International Economics. Early trade theories. The Classical Theory of Trade: The Ricardian Model.\n2. Extensions to the Ricardian Model: Wage and exchange rate limits, Transportation costs, Multiple Commodities and Countries.\n3. Setting up the Neoclassical Model: The Edgeworth Box and the Concave PPF. Gains from Trade in Neoclassical Theory: Production and Consumption Gains. Minimum Conditions for Trade and the Compensation Principle.\n4. The basis for Trade: Factor Abundance and Factor Intensity in the Heckscher-Ohlin Model. The Factor Equalization Theorem and The Samuelson Theorem.The theoretical qualifications of the H-O model and the Specific-Factors Model.\n5. Post-Heckscher-Ohlin Theories of Trade: Linder Theory and the Krugman Model. Intra-Industry Trade.\n6. International Factor Movement: FDIs and Multinational Corporations, Labour Movements Between Countries.\n7. The Instruments and the Impacts of Trade Policies.\n8. Arguments for Interventionism: Trade Policy and Imperfect Competition\n9. The political Economy of Trade Policy. Multilateral Negotiations\n10. The Theory of Regional Economic Integration: Trade Creation and Trade Diversion.\n\nReadings\/Bibliography\nDennis R. Appleyard and Alfred J. Field, International Economics, 9th. ed. (International Student Edition), McGraw Hill (2017)\nor\n\nISBN 9781307917956 CREATE MCGRAW-HILL - INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS – ALVISI (2023)\nSlides prepared by the instructor and other materials will be made available during the course.\nTeaching methods\nLectures, class discussion, courseworks. Students are advised to read the material beforehand. The material pertaining to every single lecture is indicated in the detailed syllabus published in the website\nhttps:\/\/virtuale.unibo.it\/\nat the beginning of the course.\nAssessment methods\nStudents attending lectures (for a minimum of 6 out of 10 lectures):\n1.Class attendance and participation (10%), assessing the ability to discuss the material during class discussions.\n2. Two Written tests (the first counting for 40% and the second for 50% of the final grade). \nEach test consists in a 1h15 mnts, closed-book written examination, evaluating the theoretical knowledge acquired during the course. More specifically, the test consists of 1 open question (with choice, 1 of 2 available questions, maximum 16 points) and 4 multiple-choice questions in which the student is asked to justify his\/her answer based on the theory studied (with choice, 4 of 6 available multiple-choice questions, maximum 4 points each). The whole exam is worth a total of 32 points maximum. Students with 31 or 32 points get a \"30 cum laude\" mark.\n\nStudents not attending lectures:\nThe assessment will be 100% based on a 2-hour, closed-book written examination, testing the theoretical knowledge acquired during the course. The exam consists of 2 open questions (maximum 10 points each) and 6 multiple-choice questions (in which the student is asked to justify his\/her answer based on the theory studied - maximum 2 points each) on the whole program. The whole exam is worth a total of 32 points maximum. Students with 31 or 32 points get a \"30 cum laude\" mark.\n\nScores\nIn their answers, students must prove a good mastering of the topics, ability to perform critical analysis and appropriate technical jargon.\nTherefore, excellence (16 points or cum laude in the open question and 4 points in the multiple-choice questions) is awarded to answers showing excellent mastering of the topic (exhaustive, correct, and complete), excellent analysis and perfect use of the jargon.\nVery good performance (14 - 15 points in the open question or 3\/4 points in the multiple-choice questions) is achieved with correct, fully exhaustive, and complete answers, showing a very good critical thinking.\nGood performance (11 - 13 points in the open question or 3 points in the multiple-choice questions) is achieved with correct answers, showing a good level of completeness and exhaustivity and fairly good critical analysis.\nSufficiency (9 - 10 points in the open question or 2 points in the multiple-choice questions) is achieved with correct answers, showing a satisfactory ability to perform critical analysis and mostly correct jargon.\n \nNon programmable calculators are allowed during the exam. However, no substitutes (cell phones, tablets or similar) are permitted.\nTeaching tools\nSlides and other material will be available on the course website.\nDuring the first three weeks a tutor will offer 1-2 review sessions on the economic tools that the Professor will use in the remainder of the course.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Matteo Alvisi"

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nThe aim of the course is to introduce students to the laws that govern international transport of goods and financing of trade operations, with a specific focus on documentary credit, and to provide students with a critical knowledge of the issues that operators meet daily. The course has a cross-disciplinary approach, since it will deal with public law, international law and contract law topics. In particular, on the one hand, the transport sector is deeply regulated, at the international, EU and domestic levels; on the other, carriage contracts of goods and documentary credit are relevant examples of the role that international organizations and associations play in setting the parties’ rights and obligations with model contracts and clauses. Through the interactive discussion of leading cases and the exam of standard forms and clauses developed by the relevant international actors, at the end of the course students know the basic principles that govern transports and documentary credit, are able to understand the impact of the international and EU regulation and to apply the knowledge and expertise achieved during the course in real-life contexts, taking into consideration also the other contracts involved in international trade and the legal risks actually faced by operators in different scenarios.\nCourse contents\nThe International Transport and Documentary Credit Law course will provide students with an introduction to the regime of carriage contracts also with a practical approach and to payment methods, in particular documentary credit.\nThe topics will be also addressed paying also attention to the issues related to international sales.\n\nIn particular, the course will cover the following topics, taking into consideration also other (compulsory or optional) teachings provided by the same Course:\n\nThe regulation of transport markets;\nThe provision of transport services and competition issues;\nInternational sales contracts and their interplay with international carriage contracts;\nThe ICC Incoterms® Rules;\nPayment methods in international contracts;\n\nFocus on documentary credit.\n\n\nStudents will benefit from the exam of case studies, to be discussed together during classes, and particular attention will be given to international standard forms and clauses and internationally recognized practices, where the case.\nReadings\/Bibliography\nStudents can prepare for the exam on Prof. Orrù’s presentations and the materials uploaded on the course’s website on https:\/\/virtuale.unibo.it.\nFurther useful material for preparing the exam or deepening specific topics that could be of interest for the students, could be suggested during the classes also through notices published on the above-mentioned platform, which will be used also for communications addressed to all the students.\nStudents are therefore kindly invited to enroll in the course's website on 'Virtuale'. For this purpose, students have to log in the University website with their own personal institutional credentials and scroll the menu 'Online services' in the header of Unibo home page, above the website logo. The Unibo website provides students with instructions and tutorials for using the 'Virtuale' platform and other useful services.\nThe following books and materials, available at the Unibo libraries and\/or as ebooks in the Unibo depository, are suggested for those interested in deepening the topics discussed during the classes, with the recommendation of paying attention that some of them mainly deal with English domestic laws:\n\nMichael Bundock (ed.), Shipping law handbook, 6th edn, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon; New York, Informa Law from Routlegde, 2019,\nGuillermo C.

After some lessons devoted to introduce and discuss a topic, a practical lesson will follow. It will be held in presence or on-line via MS Team platform, depending on the actual number of students and on the specific situation. \nThis lesson will allow the students to test themselves on the topics discussed in the previous lessons with case studies or model contracts. Further materials helpful for participating in this lesson will be uploaded on-line in advance.\nFor this purpose, students will be divided into groups, within which they will autonomously (but under Prof. Orrù's supervision) deal with the specific assignment. In the lesson's final part, the case studies dealt with by the students or the model contracts applied by them will be discussed together.\nWorkshops concerning specific topics and involving the participation of experts could be organized: students will be informed about them during the course and also through notices published on the professor's website.\nAssessment methods\nAssessment methods for students having regularly attended classes:\nStudents having attended at least 50% of classes could benefit from the following assessment method: a short paper on a topic to be agreed together with Prof. Orrù during classes and to be presented during one of the final classes. The paper has to be submitted to Prof. Orrù within the first date scheduled for the exam.\nThe assessment will concern both the presentation (30% of the score) and the paper (70% of the score), in particular the student’s ability to examine the given topic, highlighting the main issues, also through the available bibliographic and case-law resources, provided that in order to pass the exam a sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the topics discussed in the presentation and in the paper and adequate language skills are needed. The assessment will be, in particular based on the following criteria:\n- basic analysis of the subject-matter and the issues there implied, without the capacity of autonomously identifying and deepening all of them; an acceptable, but very short blbliography; basic yet appropriate language: 18-19\/30;\n- ability to identify the main issues involved in the subject-matter; ability to autonomously address their analysis, still developed at a rather basic level; quite well developed bibliography; use of appropriate language: 20-24\/30;\n- comprehensive analysis of the subject-matter, based on an appropriate bibliography; ability to autonomously identify and critically analyse the issues involved in the subject-matter, use of specific terminology: 25-29\/30;\n- extensive analysis of the subject-matter, based on a very accurate bibliograhy; ability to reason autonomously and critically identify and analyse the related issues, make connections between the topics, also with regard to the other content examined during the classes, ability to master the specific terminology and ability to present the arguments: 30-30 Hons\/30.\nThe score will be out of 30\/30, with honours for the best students. The minimum score for passing the exam is 18\/30. The student can refuse the mark, but s\/he will have to sit for the normal exam (see the para. below).\n\nAssessment method for students that did not regularly attend classes:\nThe other students will be assessed by a 45-minute multiple-choice exam. The exam will consist of 31 questions, based on Prof. Orrù’s presentations and materials that will be uploaded on the 'Virtuale' platform and recommended on its forum. Each question will have 3 possible answers, only one of which is correct. Each right answer will give one point, so that it will be possible to get the maximum score of 30 with honours, whereas each wrong answer will give no penalty. The score will be out of 30\/30, with honours for the best students. The minimum score for passing the exam is therefore 18\/30.\nDuring the exam the use of aids, such as textbooks, notes, computer devices, is not allowed.\nTeaching tools\nPower point presentations and teaching materials, which will be uploaded on the 'Virtuale' platform, multimedia tools for interactive and dynamic teaching, books and papers meant to deepen some topics of the course.\nFurther technological materials, deemed useful to teaching purposes, could be used.\nDisabled Students or with specific learning disabilities (SLD) needing compensatory tools, may inform the professors about their needs in order to be addressed to the School’s specific Services and agree on suitable measures.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Elena Orrù"

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nThe goal of this course is to introduce students to the vast field of behavioral economics, an interdisciplinary area that employs the employs concepts from economics and psychology to gain a deeper understanding of individual behavior. The theory has important applications to finance, the organization of human resources and the labor market, consumer behavior, marketing, health, and the associated public policies.\nCourse contents\nRequirements:\nThe course relies on basic notions of microeconomics and game theory, and makes use of simple algebra and calculus.\nMAIN TOPICS\nPart 1: Individual decisions\nChoice under risk and uncertainty.\nIn this set of classes, we will focus on individual decision making when the payoff outcomes cannot be known for sure in advance. After having reviewed the basic concepts of Expected Utility Theory, we will discuss some “anomalies” in lottery-choice situations, and other observed departures from the theoretically optimal behaviour, and we will discuss Prospect Theory as an alternative model of choice under risk and uncertainty.\nInformation and learning\nInformation specific to individuals is often unobserved by others. Such information may be conveyed at a cost, but misrepresentation and strategic non-revelation is sometimes a problem. Informational asymmetries yield rich economic models that may have multiple equilibria and unusual patterns of behavior. Here we will consider how information is used to form and update beliefs (Bayesian updating and behavioral models of learning). Finally we will study situations in which people may learn from others’ actions, giving rise to bandwagon effects.\nPart 2: Behavioral Game Theory\nThis part presents several games in which behavior is influenced by intuitive economic forces in ways that are not captured by basic game theory. We will consider models that try to account for these empirical regularities, by relaxing the strong game-theoretic assumptions of perfect rationality and perfect predictions of others’ decisions.\nPart 3: Social preferences\nBilateral bargaining\nThis part focuses on the issues of fairness, equity, trust and reciprocity within the framework of bilateral bargaining. We will review the vast experimental literature on these issues, which highlight how – under several circumstances – observed behavior tends to depart in substantial ways from the standard theoretical predictions.\nPublic choice\nThis part focuses on situations in which the outcome, and the social welfare, depends on the behavior of a large set of agents. We will study situations where the actions taken by some people affect the well being of others. Examples are the provision of public goods, and the exploitation of common resources.\nPart 4: Behavioral macroeconomics and behavioral finance\nBehavioral macroeconomics\nThis part covers studies that are motivated by macro issues of consumption, banking, and multi-market production, in the attempt to provide some insights in the understanding of banking and macroeconomics crises.\nBehavioral finance\nThis part reviews the main insights from the field of Behavioral finance, which approaches the study of financial phenomena through the lenses of models that do not rely on the assumption of agents' full rationality. We will explore the main types of deviations form full rationality that have been shown to impact on financial markets, the emergence of financial bubbles, and the literature on the \"limits to arbitrage,\" which discusses the consequences that these departures from the rationality paradigm may have on the equilibrium outcomes.\nReadings\/Bibliography\nMain references:\nHolt, Charles A.

National Bureau of Economic Research. https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w24723\nThe lecture notes will be updated the day before each class on the course’s e-learning platform: https:\/\/virtuale.unibo.it\/course\/view.php?id=40236.\nTeaching methods\nTeaching will combine participation in mock-experiments, active on-line learning exercises, and traditional lecturing. Attending classes is not compulsory but highly recommended, as participation in the classroom experiments and discussions is meant to help students’ understanding of the topics of the course.\nAssessment methods\nThe final exam aims at verifying the acquisition of the following learning outcomes:\n— basic knowledge of the methodology of experimental economics;\n— understanding of the main differences between the predictions of the standard neoclassical model and the alternative predictions of behavioral models.\n— ability to apply behavioral models to interpret and predict behavior in simple frameworks.\nStudents will be assessed based on their performance in a written and oral final exam, which will include a set of questions covering both the mathematical\/analytical aspects of the models discussed in class and their interpretation. The first part of the exam will be held in the computer lab. Questions will be randomly extracted from a predefined set, so the exam content will be different for each student. The first part of the exam will contain multiple-choice questions and exercises with numerical answers. The second part of the exam is oral and includes open questions. Students will access the second part of the exam only if they pass the first part—which is automatically graded by the software.\nIn case online exams will be envisaged by the University of Bologna, the structure of the written exam is the same. The exam will be run through Zoom and Exams Online (EOL). Detailed instructions on how to manage and hand in the online exam are available on the course page on the VIRTUALE platform.\nIn the written part of the final exam, students may use calculators (but not other electronic devices), but they may not communicate with others, consult notes, books, or other written material. Any attempt to violate these rules will result in the student's exclusion from the exam.\nThe written part of the final exam lasts one hour. Students also have the option of taking two midterm exams. The structure of the full exam is simply the sum of the content of the two midterms.\nThe dates of the final exams are fixed and cannot be changed. Requests for additional dates will not be accepted.\nThe maximum grade in the final exam is 30 cum laude – and this also holds for the two midterm exams. In case the student takes the midterm exams, the final grade is given by the average of the grades obtained in the first and in the second midterm.\nThe grade is graduated as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 cum laude - excellent\nGrade rejection: students can reject the grade obtained at the exam only once. To this end, they must email a request to the instructor within the date set for registration. The instructor will confirm reception of the request within the same date.\nRejection is intended with respect to the whole exam, whose grade is the average of the grades obtained in the two midterms. If the grade is rejected, the student must retake the full exam (consisting of both parts). The only grade that can be rejected without any communication from the student is the one of the first midterm: in this case, the student can either take the second midterm or sit the full exam (thus losing the grade obtained in the first midterm).\nStudents sitting the first midterm can take the second midterm on the first examination date set for the full exam, right at the end of the integrated course, or on the following call. A student can sit the second midterm only once; if he\/she fails or rejects the grade obtained, he\/she will have to resit the full exam and will lose the grade obtained in the first midterm.\nThe bonus points from the presentation can be used again after the grade rejection, but are only valid in case the student passes the exam by February.\nTeaching tools\nDuring the course, students will be involved in mock experiments, which should provide them with a more vivid idea of the issues to be examined later during the lecture, and active participation to the in-class discussion will be encouraged.\nAttending the classes is not compulsory, but highly recommended.\nStudents will also be requested to constantly test their understanding of the basic concepts discussed in class by means of quizzes that will be published on the on-line e-learning platform (IOL) at the end of each week. Quizzes are not compulsory, can be retaken as many times as students wish, and will not be corrected. The tutor of the course will be available one hour per week to answer questions on the quizzes.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Maria Bigoni"

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course student has knowledge of a detailed analysis of the main areas in labor economics, both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective. Topics include the analysis of labor supply by individual and households, labor demand by firms, equilibrium wage differentials and employment outcomes resulting from the interaction of such supply and demand, education and human capital, life-cycle profiles, job search models, and labor market institutions. At the end of the course student has an understanding of how labor markets work and possess the basic tools to undertake original research in the field.\nCourse contents\nThis is a graduate-level (Master and PhD), research-oriented course in labor economics. The goal is to introduce students to advanced analysis of labor markets and to provide them with tools to engage in independent research in labor economics. We will cover the following topics:\n- The methodology of advanced labor economics\n- Labor supply and demand\n- Search and matching (with applications to active labor market policy and minimum wages)\n- The Roy model (with applications to immigration and education policy)\nReadings\/Bibliography\n- Lecture notes.\n- Labor Economics, Second Edition, by Pierre Cahuc, Stéphane Carcillo and André Zylberberg, MIT Press, 2014 (a useful, though not required, graduate-level textbook).\n- Research articles assigned during the semester.\nTeaching methods\nLectures will illustrate theory and empirical applications, and will guide students to independent study and critical thinking.\nAssessment methods\nProblem sets will be assigned during the semester. The final exam consists of a report and presentation of a research article related to the topics studied in class, chosen from a list prepared by the instructor. The final grade is computed as follows: problem sets 30%; final exam 70%. The maximum possible grade is 30 cum laude. The grading scale is the following:\n\n<18: Fail\n18-23: Sufficient\n24-27: Good\n28-29: Very good\n30: Excellent\n30 cum laude: Outstanding (the instructor was impressed)\nTeaching tools\nThe Virtuale platform will provide the following resources:\n\n- Updated information and notices\n- Class slides\n- Research articles\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Giulio Zanella"

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nThis is a graduate-level course in growth economics and long term development. The course presents a detailed analysis of the state of the art research on long run growth in both a time series and a cross-country perspective. Topics include theoretical and empirical analysis of the fundamental determinants of economic growth from a multi-disciplinary perspective. The course focuses attention, in particular, on the role of economic and political institutions, geography and demography. By the end of the course the student will acquire theoretical and empirical tools that allow him\/her to get a deep understanding of the recent literature, to build his\/her own critical views, and to start undertaking original research in the field.\nCourse contents\nThe course is organized into two conceptual blocks. The first part introduces the main facts of long-run cross country development in multiple dimensions. These include in particular economic, demographic, and political development. As a first step, we present the theoretical fundamentals and existing arguments put forwards to study these dynamics in the different domains ant their interactions. We discuss existing evidence starting from reduced form empirical evidence derived from cross country panel data. We then push the view towards the state of the art recent research that aims at understanding the evolution of comparative development in history with the use of disaggregated historical data and multiple methods including also quantitative and structural estimation analysis.\nDuring the course we will present research articles that will be selected on topics also accounting for the specific interests of enrolled students. \nUnderstanding of basic theory (for instance game theory, growth theory), panel data econometrics and causal inference is required.\n \n \nReadings\/Bibliography\nA baseline list of papers will be circulated at the beginning of the course. Further paper selected by topics will be chosen during the course also depending on the interests of students.\nTeaching methods\nClasses and reading of papers and Discussion in Class.\nAssessment methods\nThe exam will involve studying and replicating a published paper and presenting a paper in a final \"students' workshop\". Depending on the number of students enrolled also a mid-term (possibly take-home) exam may be organized.\nTeaching tools\nClasses with presentations and blackboard. Slides of lectures will be made available.

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course students know issues and method of Macroeconomics. Students learn to understand Macroeconomic equilibrium in protected and open economic systems and the main issues of public policy debate in Economics.\nCourse contents\nThe program covers chapters 1-21 of Mankiw's handbook (11th edition, see below) and in particular the following topics.\nIntroduction\nIntroduction to Macroeconomics\nData and models \nGDP\nClassic theory: the economy in the long run\nThe long run\nIncome production, distribution and expenditure\nEquilibrium in the goods market and in the financial market\nThe monetary system\nInflation\nCosts of inflation\nOpen economy: trade balance and net capital outflows\nOpen economy: real and nominal exchange rate\nUnemployment\nLabor market reforms in Europe and in Italy\nGrowth theory: the economy in the very long run\nEconomic growth and the Solow model: capital accumulation, steady state, policy, golden rule, population dynamics, technological progress, empirics, growth enhancing policies\nEndogenous growth\nBusiness cycle theory: the economy in the short run\nIntroduction to short run fluctuations: AD-SRAS-LRAS IS-LM model\nEconomic policy, shocks, IS-LM and AD\nGreat depression, Japanese stagnation, Great recession, European sovereign debt crisis, Covid-19 pandemics\nFiscal and monetary policy in the EU since the Great recession\nMundell- Fleming model\nInternational financial crises\nAggregate supply and Phillips curve \nAdaptive and rational expectations\nThe debate on macroeconomic policy\nStabilization policy\nDebt and deficit\nFinancial system: opportunities and dangers \nReadings\/Bibliography\nN. Gregory Mankiw, Macroeconomics, 12th Edition, Macmillan, 2025\nFor some arguments we will also refer to CORE Econ, The Econmy (1.0 and 2.0)\nTeaching methods\nLectures, tutorials, and home assignments for attending students\nAssessment methods\nMandatory written exam (computerized): 30 points available. It consists of 9 multiple choice questions (2 points each) and 4 open questions (3 points each).\nOptional oral exam: +\/- 3 points from the grade of the written exam (mandatory to obtain \"30\/30 cum laude\"). The oral exam consists of 3 questions on the entire program, whose answers may increase or decrease the grade by one point each.\nThe oral exam can be taken only at the first session following the written exam. Admission to the oral exam requires a grade of at least 15\/30 in the written exam.\nPartial exams: for attending students there will be a partial exam after the first half of the course (on the program of chapters 1-7); the second partial exam (on the remaining program) can be sustained either at the end of the course (the day of the first full exam) or at the following session (the day of the second full exam), but it can be sustained only once. The final grade, which can be recorded or modified through the optional oral exam, will be the simple average of the two partial exams. Even for those opting for partial exams, the optional oral exam covers the entire program.\nIn both written and oral exams the evaluation depends on the correctness, completeness and rigor of the answers.\nRegistration on AlmaEsami is mandatory both for written exam sessions and for the \"Oral and grade recording\" session immediately following the completion of the written exam. Those who show up at this session will be able to review the corrections and choose whether to give the oral exam or not. Those who do not show up will have the grade of the written exam recorded. \nOFA: students with OFA in Math cannot sustain either total or partial exams.\nErasmus: at most 20 Erasmus and Overseas students, and 10 UADE students, selected in chronological order, will be admitted to the course and the exam.\n\nHome assignements: for those attending the course and taking partial exams, there will be bi-weekly home assignements. Handing in all assignements raises the grade of each partial exam by 1 point. \nFractionary final grades obtained in the written exam will be approximated to the superior unit above 0.5 included, and to the inferior unit otherwise.\nThe (rounded) final grade  can be refused only once.\nGrading scale:\n< 18: failed\n18-23: sufficient\n24-27: good\n28-30: very good\n30 e lode: outstanding\n\nTeaching tools\nSlides published online in advance.\nStudents with disability or specific learning disabilities (DSA) are required to make their condition known to find the best possibile accommodation to their needs.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Paolo Vanin"

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course students are able to understand and use the main variable, theories and tools of marketing managemant. After discussing some main theoretical frameworks at hte end of the course students will be able to aplly them to the real company and market contest. Students are able to analyse behavior and after sale behavior of costumers, to segment the market, to define a marketing plan and decide the main section of marketing mix such as product and brand management, pricing, distribution channels and comunication.\nCourse contents\nThe course is designed to provide a broad understanding of marketing and the role of marketing in the society, from the basics to the most recent advancements of the discipline. It drives students to understand the basic principles and theories of marketing and it aims to offer students models and tools to manage the exchange process between firms and customers.\nThe course is structured in two main modules:\n\nThe first part of the course is dedicated to the diagnostic nature of marketing activity, with the aim to familiarize students with the fundamentals of marketing research, that is developing research questions, analyzing data and drawing inferences, with a view to making better business decisions. Here, the course is a walk through the main strategic decisions falling under the marketing domain: analyzing consumer needs, developing segmentation and targeting positioning, developing marketing strategies and plans. \nThe second part of the course is focused on the implementation side of the marketing, where main strategic policies are concretely realized and oriented to the market: students will discuss how a product can be launched and managed and how a marketing strategy can be implemented through distribution decisions, sales force management, pricing decisions, communication decisions. A specific focus will be dedicated to the emerging role of \"marketing as a force for good\" in line with the most recent advancements of the discipline and practice. \n\nThe course is held during the months of September-December\n \nReadings\/Bibliography\nThe required textbook is: \nTitle: Marketing Management, \nAuthors: Russ Winer, Ravi Dhar\nPublisher: Prentice Hall (International Edition) Fourth Edition\nYear: 2014 \nLecture notes\nStudents will be equipped with slides and additional material during the course that will be uploaded on Virtuale in .pdf format before each class, so that students can bring a printed version of the slides to annotate them during class at their convenience. \nTeaching methods\nEach class is either primarily a lecture or a case analysis and discussion. Exercises and teamwork will be also developed to open discussion about how to analyze read data and apply the concepts to real cases. \nGuest speakers will be invited to bring also a practical perspective to the course.\nWe will learn that marketing is an evolving discipline so lectures will be continously filled with real examples from the practice. Students will also be asked to bring their own examples in class by observing what is happening during their daily life (at the supermarket, on social media platforms, by watching TV or by reading the newspaper). \nParticipation of Exchange Students:\n\nA maximum of 20 exchange students (Erasmus, Overseas, etc.) is accepted. FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED logic will be used for incoming students.\nAssessment methods\nThough not compulsory, class attendance and participation in team-work assignments is strongly encouraged. Team-work assignments consist of:\na) One intermediate short team-work project at the end of the first term\nb) One final team-work project at the end of the second term\nDetails about the topic of the team-work projects will be presented during lectures. \nCourse evaluation will be different depending on the participation in team-work assignment, as detailed in the following:\nStudents participating in team-work assignments:\n50% final written exam\n50% team-work assignment\nStudents who do not participate in team-work assignments:\n100% final written exam\n \nThe evaluation criteria for the project work are the following:\n- Exhaustivity of the presentation\n- Ability to address the topic correctly\n- Presentation skills\n- Respect of the allotted time\nFinal written exam\nStudents can attend a mid-term exam (not compulsory) during the teaching break at the end of the first sub-cycle, and then the second mid-term exam at the end of the course. The grades of the two mid-term exams will be averaged to compute the “final written exam” grade.\nBy School regulation, those who positively pass the first mid-term exam (i.e. grade greater or equal to 18), have the chance to take the second mid-term exam either in the January or February session. However, the second mid-term can be taken only once. Therefore, if a student does not pass the second mid-term exam (or opts for a re-take), s\/he can attend only total exams from that moment on.\nThe course material chapters on the topics discussed in the team-work assignments will be excluded from the exam program for those students who will participate in team-work assignments.\nThe evaluation criteria for the final exam are the following:\n- Ability to answer correctly the questions\n- Quality of response\/length of the response ratio\nGrading\nThe test assessment grid is determined as follows:\n- < 18 insufficient\n- 18-23 sufficient\n- 24-27 average\/good\n- 28-30 very good\n- 30 cum laude excellent\/outstanding\nTeaching tools\nTeaching materials essential to the course and compulsory for the exams is available thorough \"Teaching resources on Virtuale\".\nStudents with disability or specific learning disabilities (DSA) are required to make their condition known to find the best possibile accomodation to their needs\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Annamaria Tuan"

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nThis course is designed to review students' knowledge of elementary mathematics and to expose them to some of the mathematical concepts and techniques that are required to study mathematical models in the social sciences. \nUpon completing this course, students should be able to identify, sketch and analyze functions; to solve several types of equations and systems of linear and quadratic inequalities; to know the basic theory of matrix algebra; to explain the concept of a derivative and to differentiate single variable functions using different rules of differentiation.\nCourse contents\n\n Linear Algebra: matrix algebra, gaussian elimination, determinants, inverse of a matrix, solutions of a linear system\nReal function of a real variable: definition, graph of a function, elementary functions, injective and surjective functions, compound functions, invertible function. \nDifferentiation: definition, tangent and derivatives, rules for differentiation, higher order derivatives, implicit differentiation, Taylor's formula, De l'Hopital's rule. Concave and Convex functions\nLimits: function's limit definitions, infinitesimal order and infinite order, operations with limits; continuous functions.\nOptimization: local extreme points and global extreme points.\n\nQualitative analysis of the graphs of simple functions.\nIntegrals: definition, integration of elementary functions, integration rules\nFunctions of many variables: partial derivatives, level surfaces, linear approximation, differential, unconstrained optimization, constrained optimization (the lagrange multiplier method)\n\nDuring the study of any of the above topics, examples of applications to economics and social sciences problems will be analyzed.\n \nIn order to be able to attend the course it is required a basic knowledge in high school mathematics consisting in: polynomials algebra, roots, exponential and logarithmic functions (and related properties), equations and inequalities involving polynomials, roots, exponetials and logarithms.\nReadings\/Bibliography\nStudents notes together with teacher tablet notes class by class uploaded on Virtuale are enough to overcome the exam, obviously provided they are correct and complete.\nLecture notes with lists of exercises for every topic will be provided by the professor. \nFor further reading it is suggested book: \nK. Sydsaeter, P. Hammond, A. Strom \"Essential Mathematics for Economic Analysis\", Pearson\nTeaching methods\nDue to the different mathematical backgrounds and knowledge of the students, a crash course is organized before the start of the lectures. Attendance is strongly recommended for all students.\nTraditional classes using the blackboard or a tablet\nAssessment methods\nThe assessment is made through a written exam.\n\n\nThe full exam is made by a multiple choices quiz and by a part with open exercises. The total maximum score in the written exam is 33 of which at most 18 reacheable in the quiz.\n\n\nA mid-term written exam is scheduled between the two sub-cycles based on around half of the program. Students that achieve a score of at least 15 out of 33, can take a final exam focused on the topics of the second part of the course: the final exam is scheduled simultaneously to the full exams sessions in January and February calls. Mid-term and final exams are made of a multiple choices quiz and open exercises too and the final grade is given by the arithmetic average of the two single scores.\n\nTeaching tools\nBlackboard and tablet\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Sabrina Mulinacci"

Only in an emergency situation (e.g. a return of the recent health emergency) may if be necessary to administer exams “online” for some or all students. This will not affect the structure of the written exam. However, written exams taken \"online\" may need to be supplemented with an oral exam. Online written exams would be administered using a combination of two software packages: most likely ZOOM and EOL (esami online). \n\nCandidates will be required to enroll for exams via the University's electronic service (currently AlmaEsami).

After the date specified, marks will be electronically registered (verbalizzato).\nFinal grades for the course will be out of 30. A grade of at least 18 is required to pass the course, and the maximum is 30 with distinction (“30 e lode”). As a guide, the grade scale (for “pass” grades) can be thought of as follows:\n- 18 – 22: Adequate\n- 23 – 25: Good\n- 26 – 27: Very good\n- 28 – 30: Excellent\n- 30 e lode: Outstanding\nTeaching tools\nSlides\nExample exercises\nStudents with a disability or specific learning disabilities (DSA) are required to make their condition known in order that the best possible accommodation to their needs may be found.\n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Matthew John Wakefield"

This will form the basis of the “supply” side of the market.\nUnit 3: Scarcity, wellbeing and working hours\nWe will develop the building blocks of individual decision-making and how individuals make trade-offs between consumption and leisure. This will build the basis of the “demand” side of the market.\nUnit 4: Strategic interactions and social dilemmas\nWe will introduce concepts from “game theory” to understand how individuals interact and study the emergence and resolution of various social dilemmas.\nUnit 5: The rules of the game: what gets what and why\nWe will study how institutions, which form the “rules” of an economic system, shape economic outcomes. We will discuss issues of fairness and efficiency.\nUnit 6: The firm and its employees\nWe will study the structure of the firm and the interaction of firms and employees. \nUnit 7: The firm and its customers\nWe will study how the firm interacts with customers and how the structure of the market affects the relationship between firms and customers. We will introduce ideas of profit maximization, perfect competition and monopoly. \nUnit 8: Supply and demand: markets with many buyers and sellers\nWe will bring together the supply and demand side of the markets to understand how markets work in a competitive equilibrium.

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nMonetary policy has the ability to shape all economic interactions in a way that no other policy does. However, the recent experience of the Great Recession has raised questions in monetary policy surrounding the limits to this power. At the same time, the development of financial markets and institutions have questioned the definition of “money” and inspired new methods and policies to address these challenges.\nWithin the area of contemporary monetary economics and monetary policy, students will learn the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in a market based economy, the role played by market liquidity and sovereign debt, the policy tools of quantitative and qualitative easing, and will acquire a deep understanding of the policy issues in the Euro Area.\nCourse contents\n Monetary aggregates and the Money multiplier\n Behind the Scenes\n\nMoney creation in the modern economy\nBanks and Liquidity Creation\n    The Monetary Transmission Mechanism, and the role of risk:\n\nTheory\nThe “broken transmission mechanism”: Evidence from\n    the great financial crisis\nthe sovereign debt crisis\nFinancial Deepening:\n\nHouseholds’ money: bank debt\nCash pools’ money: sovereign debt and triple A securities\nNowadays interbank\/money market: Repo Market\nGovernment debt securities as “quasi money”: Theory and evidence\n    Central Banks’ Policies\n\nFrom inflation targeting to (full) employment targeting\nNowadays intermediate target: financial markets’ stability\n\n Focus: \n- From Quantity Easing to Qualitative Easing: Japan, USA, ECB\n-The Euro Area Dilemma: Monetary Dominance versus Fiscal Dominance\nReadings\/Bibliography\nAll the material is on the \"Virtual Learning” platform.\nThere are 10 sections providing the material for the 10 lectures.

Important: if students pass the short test but are unsatisfied with the overall grade, retakes involve a new assignment, it is not possible to retake individual parts with a positive grade.\nStudents not delivering the coursework assignment by the end of the course will need to complete an extra part in the exam, answering questions about their assignment (an extra 45 minutes will be added to the exam time).\nTeaching tools\nThis module provides a set of case studies on the evaluation of actual programs and policies aimed at promoting health.

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nThe course introduces students to the key concepts and themes of political science. In order to do so, the course will focus on what constitutes the political domain, the empirical study of politics, the development\nand functioning of modern political institutions, the comparative analysis of political regimes with a focus on democracies and the forms of political participation.\nAt the end of the course, students will be able to analyze the key features of different political institutions\nCourse contents\nThe course introduces students to the major concepts, theories and empirical findings in political science. The first section of the course discusses the main institutions and political actors of democracies and their actual functioning (political participation and its agencies, electoral systems and party systems, legislatures, executives, judiciaries). \nThe second section explores the foundations, development, and challenges of democracy in various political contexts. Special emphasis will be on understanding democratic backsliding, illiberalism, and populism, with case studies from around the world. Students will engage with theoretical frameworks and empirical studies to critically analyze current political phenomena and their implications for democratic governance.\nPlease note that not all topics covered in the assigned readings will be dealt with in class, and some of the topics dealt with in class are not covered in the assigned readings. However, all materials of the assigned readings and all materials covered in class will be part of the exam.

Students can manage activities of market oriented companies by defining strategic framework by analysing competition and market segments; students are also able to manage and control operating porcesses.\nCourse contents\nManagement is the process which requires leading and directing an organization, through techniques and activities to use and combine different types of resources. The resources are namely: human, financial, material, intellectual, intangible. Every management course covers to some extent the five management functions: Planning, Organizing, Leading, Co-ordinating, Controlling.\nIn this course, after introducing the main issues related to the activities and contexts of management, we mainly discuss the principles, techniques and steps to use, plan, organize, lead, coordinate and control material resources. The four essential core areas of operations management and supply chain management are thus analyzed: strategy, process management, supply chain management, and inventory and control (supply and demand planning). Such concepts are integrated by the idea of sustainability as a strategic consideration.

For that exam session, only a full exam including the whole course program will be organized, with open questions, of about 60-70 minutes.\nStudents of previous years must prepare the program of the current year and can only take a full exam on the whole program.\nThe exam, both intermediate and final, has the following goals:\n· knowledge of principles of management concepts discussed during lectures , case studies and exercises.\n· capability of applying operation and supply management tools to manage companies.\n· ability to use results from management models to understand business activities and decision processes, both at the strategic and operational level.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor the students who decide to take the intermediate exam (that will take place in last part of October or at the beginning of November):\n-the intermediate exam will be evaluated from 0 to 30 (18 is pass grade);\n-a student can take part in the exam on the second part of hte program only if he\/she has passed the intermediate, that is to say with an evaluation of at least 18\/30;\n-in case of passing the exam on the second part, which means taking at least the score of 18\/30, the final grade of the couse of Principles of Management will be the arithmetic mean of the evaluations obtained in the two partial tests.\n \nIf a student decides to be evaluated by participating in an exam session including both parts of the program, the evaluation is, as usual, 0 to 30 (18 is the pass grade).\n\nTo take the exam, registration is required through the Almaesami electronic system, in compliance with the deadlines provided.\n\nThe registration of the grade achieved is done in the Almaesami system. It is possible to view the exam paper and ask for clarifications on the date indicated by the teacher. The possibility of using alternative time to view the exam paper is reserved for exceptional cases, with a valid motivation. The registration of the vote on Almaesami system will take place without the need of the student to be present or sign it.\n\nGraduating students who pass the exam and need to register the grade before the planned date, are invited to communicate it to the teacher through an email to be sent immediately after taking the exam.\n\nAs said before, the exam is carried out in writing and provides an evaluation in a scale from 0 to 30 (18 is a passing grade). In addition to answering some questions concerning the methods (\"theory questions\"), students will have to perform exercises in which they demonstrate the ability to apply the acquired tools to manage a specific practical situation in management, operation and supply chain management, verify specific hypotheses and interpret the achieved results.\n\nDuring the exam test, the use of support material such as textbooks, notes, computer or telematic media is not allowed. A student is able to pass the written test (and to also acquire the maximum assessment provided) even without attending classes, given that attendance is not mandatory; however, statistically this rarely happens.\nTeaching tools\nExcel files with management models; case, excercises and videos will be discussed in class. Students will sometime be asked to read a specific case study before class.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Angelo Manaresi"

He\/she has knowledge of the lifecycle model as a key tool for analysing the issues of interest and for understanding existing analyses. Finally, student knows topical policy questions and the recent contributions to the academic literature about how individuals are affected by, and respond to, public policy.\nCourse contents\nThe course focuses on the role for government intervention in the economy (why should government intervene?), and on some principles that might guide the design of economic policy.\nAs a particular example, the course may consider public policy regarding pensions \/ social security, and how this affects the decisions of individuals regarding consumption and saving.\nTopics may therefore include:\n\nMotives for government intervention in the economy\nRaising government revenue:\n    \nOptimal income taxation\nOptimal commodity taxation\n\n\nPensions and social security\n    \nHow is policy designed?\nHow do agents respond to policy interventions?\n\n\n\nReadings\/Bibliography\nBasic graduate \/ advanced undergraduate textbooks include:\nGruber, J., Public Finance and Public Policy\nHindriks, J., and Myles G.D., Intermediate Public Economics\nA more advanced text is:\nAtkinson A.

Potentially also lessons to work through exercises led by course lecturer.\nStudents are likely to be asked to present material to lead discussion on some topics. The use of such innovative teaching methods will be adapted depending on class size.\nAssessment methods\nAssessment will be based on a final written exam, and on the lecturer’s assessment of student performance in class presentation(s).\nThe final written exam of about one or one and a half hours.\nThe exam will be a combination of exercises and open (essay) questions. Example questions will be provided during the course.\nThe exam will be “closed book” and so during exams students will NOT be allowed to use materials such as: textbooks, lecture notes\/slides; any written notes; web-enabled or data storage devices such as computers (laptops or tablets), or smartphones. Candidates found with such items will be disciplined.\nThe content and structure of exam questions is intended to assess familiarity with the material covered in the course lectures, and, in particular, to assess understanding of the implications for public economics of the material covered in the course.\nDue to the ongoing health emergency, it is possible that exams may need to be administered “online” for some or all students. This will not affect the structure of the exam. Online exams would be administered using a combination of two software packages: ZOOM and EOL (esami online).\nCandidates will be required to enroll for exams via the University's electronic service (currently AlmaEsami). Exam marks will be published via the University's electronic service (AlmaEsami). After exams students will be entitled to see their script by attending the lecturer’s office hour.\nStudents will be allowed to reject their final grade for the course exactly ONCE. When exam results are published, the date by which students must notify the course lecturer of their intention to reject their mark, will be communicated to candidates.

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nThe course introduces students to key sociological concepts and topics and encourages the development of skills pertaining to the understanding and investigation of social phenomena from a sociological perspective. Students completing the course will be familiar with the main epistemological orientations in contemporary social science debates; analyze key features of social structure, social inequality, social change and comparative research; critically assess different sociological approaches; make decisions involving the design and execution of social research projects.\nCourse contents\nPlease note: the course is scheduled to begin on Tuesday, September 17th.\nThe course is an introduction to sociology and some basic concepts underlying social research methodology. The course will lay out the fundamental tenets of the discipline, including typical definitions, questions, theories, methods, perspectives and topics. The issues addressed by the course include:\n- the aims of sociology: description of social phenomena, understanding their underlying processes, application of sociological insights\n- the formulation of useful sociological theories and the relevant conceptual tools\n- the goals of empirical research and the types of methods sociologists have at their disposal, with a focus on comparative approaches\n- typical sociological topics, with a special focus on: beliefs, attitudes and values; social norms; social relationships; social stratification, mobility and other topics linked to inequality; immigration; modernization; religion; climate change\n- the distinction between reality, thought and language, the unsteady relationship among which shapes any attempt to attain knowledge about society\n- classical sociological thinkers. \nLessons will not deal with all issues explained in the reference texts listed below and also involve issues not addressed by said texts. The exam is based both on mastery of the reference texts listed below and the additional topics discussed in class.\nBe aware: the course requires a high level of English language proficiency.\nExchange students: carefully read the \"Assessment methods\" section below! \n  \n \nReadings\/Bibliography\nReference texts:\n\n- van Tubergen, Frank, Introduction to Sociology, Routledge, 2020\n\n- Corbetta, Piergiorgio, Social Research: Theory, Methods and Techniques, Sage, 2003: chapters 1-3 [https:\/\/methods.sagepub.com\/book\/social-research-theory-methods-and-techniques]\n\n- Falzon, Danielle, J.

Attending students are offered the opportunity to take an (optional) intermediate exam approximately mid-way through the lesson plan (first week of November 2024). The exam is based on the reference texts. \nThe second half of the exam, for those taking the intermediate exam, and the full exam will be offered once in January 2025, once in February 2025 and again in the late August-September 2025 period. Please note the first available period for completing\/taking the full exam will be in January; this is unavoidable for all exams in the EPOS degree programme, and interested students (especially international exchange students) need to adapt travel plans accordingly. There will be no alternative dates and no altermative modes for earning credits. If this is pronblematic, do NOT include this course in your study plan.\nExams are administered in exclusively *written* form and *in person*. The only valid mark is the one achieved in the most recent attempt to pass the exam.

(2021). Statistics: Principles and Methods, Pearson.\n\n\nLecture notes that will be made available online at the beginning of the course on the platform Virtuale\n\n\nFor further reading: Anderson, D.R., Sweeney, D.J., Williams, T.A., Camm. J.D., Cochran, J.J., Freeman, J., Shoesmith, E. (2020), Statistics for Business and Economics, Cengage Learning EMEA, Andover, UK. 5th Edition.\n \n\n\n\nFor topic 4 of the \"Course contents\" section the recommended readings are:\n\nE-Book: \"R Programming\", tutorialspoint. Website: https:\/\/www.tutorialspoint.com\/r\/index.htm\n\n\nE-Book: \"Get started in R: a complete beginners workbook\", R Statistics.Net. Website: http:\/\/rstatistics.net\/r-tutorial-exercise-for-beginners\/\n\nTeaching methods\nFor topics 1-3 of the \"Course contents\" section: Traditional classroom lectures\nFor topic 4 of the \"Course contents\" section: Classroom lessons and practice using the student's notebook. It is therefore important that the students bring their personal notebooks during the lab lessons. In the absence of a personal notebook, the student can work with a partner. \nAssessment methods\nFormat\nFor both Module 1+3 and Module 2 the assessment is via a written examination.The Module 1+3 full exam will comprise exercises and theoretical questions on all the topics covered in class. Examples of past exam papers will be made available at the beginning of the Module. The Module 2 exam is a pass\/fail written test. The Module 2 test can be taken on any of the available dates regardless on when the Module 1+3 exam is taken. The Module 1+3 mark will be registered only after passing the Module 2 test. \nStudents taking the Module 1+3 first midterm exam can sit the Module 1+3 second midterm exam only if they obtained a sufficient mark. The Module 1+3 second midterm exam can be taken only once either right at the end of the Module or on the following call. If the student fails the Module 1+3 second midterm exam, he\/she will have to resit the Module 1+3 full exam and will lose the mark obtained in the Module 1+3 first midterm exam.\nIn some cases, after the Module 1+3 full or second midterm exam, the lecturer may require an oral test as a further tool of assessment of the student's preparation.\n \n \n\nGrade rejection\nStudents can reject the grade obtained at the Module 1+3 exam once. To this end, he\/she must email a request to the instructor within the date that will be specified after the notification of the exam results.\nRejection is intended with respect to the whole Module 1+3 exam. If the grade is rejected, the student must retake the full Module 1+3 exam, even if the second midterm exam was taken. The only grade that can be rejected without any communication from the student is the one of the Module 1+3 first midterm exam: in this case the student can either take the Module 1+3 second midterm exam or sit the Module 1+3 full exam (thus losing the grade obtained in the first midterm exam).\nTeaching tools\nFor topics 1-3 of the \"Course contents\" section: Teaching material (lecture notes, exercises, past exam papers, etc) and further information about the course will be available at the beginning of the course on the platform Virtuale.\nFor topic 4 of the \"Course contents\" section:\n\nunder the \"Teaching\" section of  Filippo Piccinini's personal website all the slides used during the lessons are available for download as well as software tools for practice.\n\n\nThe statistical software R can be freely downloaded from the web page http:\/\/http\/\/www.r-project.org\/\n\n\nThe software RStudio can be used as an interface for R and can be freely downloaded from the site https:\/\/rstudio.com\/products\/rstudio\/\n\nLinks to further information\nhttps:\/\/virtuale.unibo.it\/\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Paola Bortot\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Filippo Piccinini"

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nThe course has three main objectives: (i) explain how economists learn from empirical evidence, and how lab, field, and natural experiments can help establishing causation; (ii) teach the intuition behind some intermediate game theoretical concepts; (iii) show a wide range of applications and topics in economics\nCourse contents\nErasmus students: Please note that you cannot take this course if you have not yet taken a course in Microeconomics (a formal requirement at EPOS) AND a course in econometrics (a de facto requirement given the content of the course).\nThe course will provide a broad range of examples on how economic theory and experiments can be used to understand pressing societal problems as well as to inform governments, firms, and consumers. The applications will range from media bias to environmental conservation, from discrimination to education and social housing.\nFor each topic, we will start from simple theoretical models and will then discuss experimental evidence -- both supporting the model or showing potential limitations of the theory. While we will usually start from simple laboratory experiments and in-class demonstrations, the main focus of the course will be on field experiments. \nNote that this syllabus may be subject to changes; thus, please make sure you are checking the most updated version of the syllabus on Virtuale.\nTopic 1: Inequality\nMandatory readings:\nAlmås, I., Cappelen, A.W. and Tungodden B (2020) Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?

The slides provide some context for each topic discussed in class and offer guidance for reading the required papers. The additional readings reported in the syllabus refer to papers mentioned in the slides and can offer further understanding of the general context if some points are not clear enough from the slides themselves (especially for non-attending students).\nFor most topics, you are required to carefully read some research papers (i.e., mandatory papers). It is important to focus on the introduction, design, and identification of the causal effect. You are not required to study all the econometric analyses, just make sure to understand the regression tables reported in the slides.

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nThe course has three main objectives: (i) explain how economists learn from empirical evidence, and how lab, field, and natural experiments can help establishing causation; (ii) teach the intuition behind some intermediate game theoretical concepts; (iii) show a wide range of applications and topics in economics\nCourse contents\nErasmus students: Please note that you cannot take this course if you have not yet taken a course in Microeconomics (a formal requirement at EPOS) AND a course in econometrics (a de facto requirement given the content of the course).\nThe course will provide a broad range of examples on how economic theory and experiments can be used to understand pressing societal problems as well as to inform governments, firms, and consumers. The applications will range from media bias to environmental conservation, from discrimination to education and social housing.\nFor each topic, we will start from simple theoretical models and will then discuss experimental evidence -- both supporting the model or showing potential limitations of the theory. While we will usually start from simple laboratory experiments and in-class demonstrations, the main focus of the course will be on field experiments. \nNote that this syllabus may be subject to changes; thus, please make sure you are checking the most updated version of the syllabus on Virtuale.\nTopic 1: Inequality\nMandatory readings:\nAlmås, I., Cappelen, A.W. and Tungodden B (2020) Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?

        "description":"Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the workshop the student has fully developed under standard econometric packages a portfolio of case studies in applied health economics, through the following steps:\n1)\tdata collection, managing and validation\n2)\tdefinition of key question and model specification\n3)\testimation and testing\n4)\tpost-estimation analysis and reporting.\nThe focus is on preparatory work (steps 1 and 2) and post-estimation analysis (step 4).\nAt the end of the course the student is able to develop his\/her own applied studies from scratch.\nCourse contents\nThe purpose of the workshop is to provide students with skills in STATA required to conduct empirical quantitative analysis in health economics. The main focus of the course will be gaining familiarity with manipulating, analyzing, and interpreting data in STATA. In addition, we will discuss previous studies to demonstrate how researchers use the data and analysis techniques studied in class.\nAt the end of the workshop, the students will be able to:\n\n\n\nAutonomously find and extract data from on-line data repositories;\nPrepare data from large health-related datasets for econometric analysis;\nProduce descriptive statistics and simple data visualizations;\nPerform quantitative analysis, including regression techniques;\nReport empirical findings using relevant tables and figures in a journal-style manner;\nInterpret and comment empirical output.\n\n\n\nTeaching methods\nAll classes will be in presence, and will involve a mixture of frontal lectures and practical sessions using STATA. Students will be given exercises to provide guided practice in implementing techniques covered in class. It is strongly recommended to bring a personal computer in class with the software STATA installed. STATA is available under a unibo license for all students enrolled in DSE first, second, or third cycle degree programmes.\nAssessment methods\nThe class will be judged on a Pass\/Fail basis. Passing the course will require submitting STATA code and output relating to a guided research project. \nTeaching tools\nThe Unibo e-learning platform (Virtuale) will be used to share all relevant teaching material.
