Students are encouraged to go deeply into the topics faced in the course through careful reading of some of the suggested-book chapters and of recent - mostly review - publications to have the state-of-the-art view related to the scientific topics of the course.\n\nAssessment methods\nStudents' knowledge in the field of Active Galaxies will be based on an oral exam, starting with a topic chosen by the student (e.g., a presentation of an article related to the course topics using the dashboard), followed by questions on topics covered during the course. The student is required to link, in the most appropriate way, the various topics discussed during the course, and to be able to discuss in a critical way the main topics and open issues in modern astrophysics in the field of Active Galaxies and Super-Massive Black Holes. Besides, the student should show skiils in deriving physical quantities. \n\nTeaching tools\nPowerpoint presentations (available on the personal webpage and at IoL) and dashboard. \n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Cristian Vignali"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe aim of this course is to impart knowledge about animal diversity and biogeography linked to climate changes. In historical ages, in fact, animal natural distribution, as a product of evolution, has been often confused from anthropic activities. Climate changes, though, is currently boosting the process with an impact deeper than ever on animal diversity. Ranges of distribution can be either reduced or widened, promoting biodiversity loss/extinction or leading to new species relationships. Therefore, ecological equilibria can be severely modified, also because of the phenomenon – among others – of alien (invasive) species. Through the course - also based on current literature and online resources analyses – students will acquire the ability to discuss case studies of animal distribution following climate changes, to explain habitat dynamics (loss in biodiversity and alien species) and analyze methods for animal resources conservation halting biodiversity loss.\nCourse contents\nPrinciples of animal diversity and distribution. Niches and distribution ranges. Diversity and distribution of animals in food webs. Community composition in space and time. Population dynamics of predation and distribution of predators and prey. Terrestrial ecosystems biodiversity. Evolutionary factors: speciation and extinction; dispersal and migrations. Island biogeography. Climate change and conservation biology. Animal distribution in relation to Protected Areas. Anthropic factors affecting animal diversity and distribution. Invasive and alien species (IAS). Methods to study animal biodiversity and distribution: step 1) data collection from biodiversity platforms, online datasets, field work, etc.; step 2) data analysis through species distribution / occupancy / N-mixture models, resource selection functions, species-habitat associations, etc.; step3) interpretation of the results of the analyses and discussion of their main implications in light of conservation and management. \nReadings/Bibliography\nThere are not required books. Course material (slides, academic papers, etc.) will be provided by the instructor.\nTeaching methods\nTheoretical lectures, practical exercise with computers, analysis and presentation of case studies.\nDue to the course’s activities and learning methodologies, attendance will be subject to prior participation of all students to the following mandatory e-learning Modules 1 and 2:\nModule 1 [https://elearning-sicurezza.unibo.it/course/view.php?id=23] – Safety General Training\nModule 2 [https://elearning-sicurezza.unibo.it/course/view.php?id=43] – Safety Specific Training (part I)\nAssessment methods\nThe exam at the end of the course aims to evaluate the following achievements:\nKnowledge and understanding of biogeographical patterns of animals;\nAbility to recognize and understand factors that can modify the diversity and distribution of animal species/populations;\nUnderstanding of invasion dynamics of IAS;\nUnderstanding of the role played by anthropic activities in shaping diversity and distribution of animal species/populations;\nThe final mark will be assessed through oral examination.\nTeaching tools\nTheoretical lectures, with power point presentations and practical exercises with computers.\nAll slides, files, tutorials and other material used during the course will be provided to students by the instructor.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Marco Musiani\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Pietro Milanesi"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course, the student has the skills required for designing a system composed of one or multiple robotic agents. In particular, the student has a knowledge of the most popular models, methods, architectures, and tools for programming robotic agents endowed with significant computational and cognitive capabilities.\nCourse contents\nThe course will cover several topics in robotics. For each topic, we will first introduce it, and then discuss how it can be addressed using AI techniques, and what are the gains and challenges in doing so.\n\nHere are the topics addressed, and the corresponding AI solutions that will be explored:\n\nBasic concepts, methods and tools in robotics\nState estimation, and how to address it using reasoning under uncertainty (Bayesian approaches, fuzzy sets, Dempster-Shafer theory)\nMotion control, and how to address it using rule-based logical systems (fuzzy logic control)\nAction planning, and how to address it using AI planning systems (hierarchical HTN planning)\nHuman-robot interaction, and how to address it using knowledge representation systems (semantic maps)\nPutting it all together, using cognitive robotic architectures\nOutlook: socio-ethical issues, and the research frontier\n\n\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nReading material for each lecture will be posted on Virtuale together with the lecture.\n\n \nTeaching methods\nThe course will alternate three types of activities: presentation of concepts and problems in robotics, discussion on how AI techniques can be used to address those problems, and practical exercises.\nEach activity will involve a mixture of frontal lectures, group discussions, and laboratory work.\n\nFrontal lectures will be in presence and they will require the active participation and interaction of students; lectures will not be recorded.\nGroup discussions will be in-classroom sessions on specific topics; each session will start with presentations given by students, and continue with an open floor discussion.\nLaboratory work will consist in the execution of six assignments related to the above topics; each assignment will be introduced in the classroom, and it will then be performed autonomously by the students on their own computer outside the scheduled class times; the final (sixth) assignment will integrate all the previous ones, and it will be the basis for the oral examination (more below).\n\nIn-person attendance to all classroom activities (lectures, discussions and introduction to assignment) is required.\n\n\nAssessment methods\nThe exam consists of three parts.\n\nPart I: correct execution of all the laboratory assignments. This part aims at assessing the student's ability to use AI techniques in practical robotic systems; the grade of this part is pass or fail. Every assignment must be demonstrated to the TA, and documented in a written report; to pass, all the reports must be approved by the TA.\nPart II: delivery of a short presentation at one of the group discussion sessions, on a topic assigned by the teacher. This part aims at assessing the student's ability to critically appraise research work in AI and robotics; the grade of this part is pass or fail. Topics and guidelines for these presentations will be communicated within the first three weeks of the course, and posted in Virtuale. \nPart III: oral discussion of the final laboratory assignment. This part aims at assessing the student's knowledge of the course topics, the ability to critically analyse design choices, and the correct usage of the technical terminology. The discussion will be based on the report of the final assignment, but it may involve topics in the course beyond that. Detailed grading criteria will be communicated during the course.\n\nParts I and II must be passed in order to proceed to Part III; the final grade of the course is the one of Part III. A more detailed description of the assessment procedure and evaluation criteria is published in Virtuale.\n\n\nTeaching tools\nWe will use \"Virtuale\" for distribution of learning material and online discussions.\nLearning material will include: lecture slides, research papers, book excerpts, and links to public contents on the Internet.\nAll laboratory assignments will require the use of ROS and Gazebo, available as open source: you will need to install them on your personal computers. Installation instructions and tutorials are available online, e.g., at https://www.ros.org and https://gazebosim.org.\nNote that ROS and Gazebo work best on Linux (we will use Ubuntu 20.04) so you should have it installed on your computer. You also need a good understanding of Linux shell commands, and Python and C++ programming knowledge. It is possible to use ROS and Gazebo on MacOS or Windows, but this is not recommended and may bring difficulties. Using an Ubuntu virtual machine is an acceptable option.\n\n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Alessandro Saffiotti"

In a multiband approach, the course deals with structure of the instrumentation and criteria to evaluate and optimize their performances. It foresees a number of “external” contributions from specialists in specific areas. The course foresees as well visits to, and interactions with external laboratories. Thus, after getting common foundations, the students will be exposed to the most modern advances, in an area in continuous and fast evolution. On a side, students with specific interest in instrumentation will reach an effective starting point to be involved in instrumental projects, in scientific institutes or industries. On another side, students more interested in astrophysical results will reach a fair understanding of the observing processes which are the ground of the following developments.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course addresses in depth some fundamental topics of the astrophysics of galaxies, training the students to analyze and critically discuss papers relevant for the current research in the field. Starting from a dynamical description of the structure of galaxies, the course then examines the comparison between model and observed quantities, in particular acquired with recent observational campaigns; the evidence for dark matter, extended and in the form of central massive black holes; the properties of the hot interstellar medium; the physical origin of the main galaxy scaling laws.\nCourse contents\nThe aim of the course is a deep understanding of the structure of galaxies, especially of the \"early\" morphological type. The study focusses on modeling, and on its use to interpret observational results and evidences. In a first part, some concepts of stellar dynamics are reconsidered, and the Jeans equations are derived, as a fundamental tool for the description of the stellar orbital properties and the mass distribution. The Jeans equations are then used in a number of applications, as the \"detection\" of dark mass components, and the relation between stellar orbital properties and shape. In a second part, the modeling is used to reproduce observed morphological and kinematical properties, with a particular attention to a proper comparison between observed and theoretical quantities. A few research papers are considered in depth, as representative of consolidated results and of currently debated subjects. In summary, the main investigated topics are the following:\n1) the structure of the galaxies and of their different components; 2) the presence of dark matter: discovery and measurements; 3) the central supermassive black holes: discovery, measurement of their mass, effects on the host galaxy; 4) physical understanding of a few important scaling laws of galaxies, involving correlations between their structural/morphological/dynamical properties; 5) the stellar population in the scaling laws: roles of the IMF, age, metal abundance; 6) the relationship between the hot gas component and the stellar and dark mass components.\nReadings/Bibliography\nResearch papers on various subjects will be indicated during the lessons; fundamental textbooks as reference for many topics are the following:\n\nBinney, Tremaine: Galactic Dynamics, Princeton University Press, 1987 (2008, 2nd edition)\n\nBinney, Merrifield: Galactic Astronomy, Princeton University Press, 1998 \n\nGreggio, Renzini: Stellar Populations.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThis course will define the basis of fluid dynamics for the atmosphere and the ocean. The student will learn how to intepret the terms in the fluid dynamics equations and understand the physical modelling of those terms. At the end of the course the student will be able to identify the main atmospheric and ocean circulation structures and learn the technique for their quantitative evaluation. It will learn how to deal with turbulence at different spatial scales.\nCourse contents\nThis course is organized in 2 modules: module 1 focuses on atmospheric dynamics and module 2 in ocean dynamics.\nModule 1 syllabus:\nThis module introduces atmospheric dynamics to first year Master students. The aim is to help students to acquire an understanding of some of the basic concepts of atmospheric dynamics that will be needed as a foundation for advanced courses in climate and climate modelling. The course starts with an introduction on the atmospheric structure and the basic characteristics of large-scale atmospheric circulation. Some lectures will be devoted to the thermodynamics of the atmosphere. This is required to complete the set of equations needed for the completion of the main dynamics equations.

Reilly Media, Inc.\n\nTeaching methods\nModule 1 - Text Mining (Prof. Gianluca Moro)\nLessons and lab activities are held also online with Teams using slides and colab notebooks respectively. \n \nModule 2 - Big Data Analytics (Prof. Stefano Lodi)\nThe lessons of the course are held in a classroom. Examples are implemented in Python on Linux installed in a virtual machine (VM). The VMs will be installed in the students’ own laptops. Full instructions on how to install the VMs will be given in the first lesson.\nAssessment methods\nThe exam of the two modules is performed with a single sit and consist of two parts:\n\n1. the Verification of knowledge is tested through multiple choice questions (administered with the IoL or virtuale system). The minimum to pass this part is to answer correctly 50% of the questions of each module.\nThe weight of this part is 60%.\n2. the Verification of abilities is tested with the development of a lab project work on one (or optionally more) of the two modules selected by the students. The students, individually or in a team of up to 3 members, proposes a project to the teacher of the module selected and discusses it with the involved teacher. Each student discusses the discussion individually. \nThe size/extension of the project should be approximately equivalent to that of a lab of the module(s) selected and should take one week of work.\nA non-exhaustive list of dataset and text sets for the project is available in the \"virtuale\" teaching resources, but the students can also propose to use a different data set.\nThe weight of this part is 40%.\nTeaching tools\nModule 1 - Text Mining (Prof. Gianluca Moro)\n\nThe laboratory activities - which are carried out with Python/R using Colab - regard the following case studies:\n\nin the context of technical reports on air accidents, identification of the reasons that contribute to cause serious accidents\nextractive and abstractive text summarisation based on state-of-the-art transformer models\ndeep metric learning for cross-modal information retrieval of texts and images\nSOTA transformers for closed and open question answering, for named entity recognition (NER), for relation extraction (RE) among biomedical entities for chemical-protein and disease-disease interactions respectively, for natural language inference (NLI) to determine the validity of a hypothesis (i.e., true or false), document classification (DC) to assign a text document to a set of categories\n\n\n \n\nModule 2 - Big Data Analytics (Prof. Stefano Lodi)\nPresentation of the course topics using a overhead\nprojector. Exercises in Bring Your Own Device mode; directions on how to install the required software will be given during the course.\n\nDocuments used in the presentations are distributed on the site\n[http://iol.unibo.it].

The group works are carried out by groups of students (composed of a maximum of 3 or 4 subjects) who are formed independently and who carry out a real psychographic CRM project. The guidelines for the technical implementation of the group project are described during the course and in any case it involves applying the data analysis strategies addressed in the course to opinion data, collected by the group through an electronic questionnaire: definition of the topic, editing of the questionnaire, treatment of the distortion effects generated by the opinion scale, statistical modeling using the SAS software, drafting of the report to be delivered to the teacher.\nAssessment methods\nThe exam is an individual oral discussion of a group work. The rating scale ranges from 1 to 30 and is a continuous indicator. The oral exam consists of 3/4 questions. The starting hypothesis is that the student knows the entire exam program perfectly and that, depending on the quality of his answers, starting from 30 (maximum grade) this grade can be reduced.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course, the student has a knowledge of some advanced chapters of classical and direct methods in calculus variations, with application to some topic of deep recent interest.\nCourse contents\nMODULUS I\nIn the first part of the course, we will introduce some basic notions and methodologies in Calculus of Variations:\n\n We will start by describing the - so called- Direct Method, for proving existence of minimizers of variational functionals, in some easy situations.\n\nThen, we will introduce the class of Lipschitz functions and their main properties and study a minimization problem in such a class. This will be done under some particular assumption on the domain and on the boundary datum (the \"bounded slope condition\") and existence will be achieved via the constructions of suitable \"barriers\". As a particular case, we will consider the area functional for graphs.\nAfter this , we will introduce the class of BV functions (functions of bounded variations) and the notion of set of finite perimeter. We will state and prove some of their main properties. \nThis will allow us to consider geometric minimization problem and to establish an existence result for minimizers for a Plateau-type problem.\nFinally, we will define the notion of Reduced boundary of a set of finite perimeter and we will state the De Giorgi's structure Theorem.\n\n\nMODULUS II\nIn the second part of the course, we will deal in a mixed way into geometric problems in Calculus of Variations and some of their developements in PDEs, and partly, in regularity of PDEs. In particular,\n\nin the first part it will be discussed some fine properties of sets of finite perimeter. This will be discussed as an invitation to the topic and will be held mostly without proofs.\nThere will be proposed a slightly simplified but complete solution for the isoperimetric problem, stating that a ball minimizes the perimeter under volume constraint. The proof will follow mostly the basic De Giorgi approach, after the Steiner symmetrization technique.\nAs a first application we will show how to derive the (equivalent) Sobolev inequalities via isoperimetric ones. In particular, we will see how Sobolev inequalities are the functional counterpart of the geometric isoperimetric inequality, and how to derive by means of those compact embedding of Sobolev spaces into integrability spaces.\nAs a second application, we will see how mild (Sobolev) regularity for elliptic PDEs can be derived by means of Sobolev inequalities. This will be done via a short introduction about rearrangement functional inequalities (we will see and partly prove Hardy-Littlewood, Riesz and Polya-Szego ineuqalities).\nAs a third and last inequality, we will introduce some basics of Shape Optimization Theory. We will in particular show the Saint-Venant and the Faber-Krahn inequality.\nThe last part of the course will deal about regularity. In particular we will offer a complete proof of the solution of the XIX Hilbert problem, via the original De Giorgi proof in 1956.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nReadings/Bibliography\nLuigi Ambrosio, Nicola Fusco, Diego Pallara, \"Functions of Bounded Variation and Free Discontinuity Problems.\nL.C.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course the student will be aware of the outstanding issue of chemical sustainability. She/he will know how to exploit renewable sources of raw materials. The student will know the principles and tool of Green Chemistry and how to assess the greenness of a chemical process, exploiting Green metrics. The student will be aware of the concerns for health and the environment that the industrial use and production of solvents raises, and of the alternative safer solvents that are available nowadays and the principles for designing new ones. The student is will be able to: 1. assess the \"greenes\" of chemical processes using internationally accepted metrics; 2. design and propose chemical products and processes base on renewable feedstocks; 3. propose the use of benign solvents in place of traditional problematic ones.\nCourse contents\nContenuti\nThe UC consists of three modules, with the following contents:\n(1) Green synthesis and catalysis\n1)Homogeneous Catalysis and Heterogeneous Catalysis: Replacing Stoichiometric Reactions with Catalytic Cycles. Industrial Example. Tools in Catalysis Research: testing, characterization, modeling, mechanistic studies.\n2) The Basics of Catalysis. Kinetic, rates, orders. The rate-determining step is dead: long life to the rate determining state.\n3) Metal Complex Catalysis in the Liquid Phase. The Elementary Steps in Homogeneous Catalysis.

Preparation of catalyst. Examples.\n6) Biocatalysis. Application in Pharmaceutical industries.\n7) Organic Reaction in Water\n8) Green Photoredox Chemistry. Introduction and key concepts.\n9) Green Chemistry in Pharmaceutical Industries. Selected examples.\n(2) Green metrics\nThe module will initially discuss the parameters traditionally used to define the efficiency of a synthetic transformation (yield, chemo-, regio- and stereo-selectivity), then it will introduce new concepts related to the sustainability and environmental performance of a chemical process (chemicals toxicity and availability, hazardous reactions, waste production). Finally, starting from the seminal definition of Atom Economy by Trost, the principal green metrics introduced so far to evaluate the environmental efficiency of a synthetic transformation will be thoroughly discussed and applied to real case study examples.\n(3) Alternative Green Solvents\nSolvents are used in almost all manufacturing processes in a wide variety of applications. Many of the products we use, that are vital to everyday modern living from pharmaceuticals and personal care to household products and electronics, are all manufactured using solvents in their processes. Solvents in products such as coatings, inks, and consumer products emit substances into the air known as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). The emissions of VOCs in the atmosphere contribute to the formation of the tropospheric ozone. Solvents are a key priority when “greening” chemistry because they are used in high volume, and generate large amounts of waste, air pollution, and other health impacts. The analysis of alternatives to standardly used solvents is the goal of this module. Chemical reactivity hazards of the most common organic solvents are compared to the available green alternatives represented by water-based solvents, supercritical fluids, ionic liquids, etc. The abuse of “green labels” on the web, in advertisements, and in the literature is also critically analyzed. Selection guides for solvents will be proposed.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nModule 1\nThe vast majority of terrestrial biodiversity is microbial in origin. Microorganisms are directly involved in the ecosystem processes on which all life depends. They interact intimately with other organisms, yet we know far less about their biodiversity than that of plants and animals. Our lack of understanding of the interactions and feedbacks of microbial biodiversity is worrying given the high rates of environmental change the Earth is currently experiencing, including human-caused global climate change. The Course will mainly analyse the impact that climate change has and may have on the one hand on the different geochemical cycles (carbon Nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus) and on the other hand on the spread and alteration of microbial diseases in the different continents depending on climate change.\nModule 2\nLectures will present laboratory activities and provide basic knowledge of methods (molecular and traditional) for analysing the genetics and functions of microorganisms in environmental samples.\n\n\nCourse contents\nModule 1 \nInfluence of microorganisms on climate. Impact of climate change on microorganisms and geochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen sulphur, phosphorus). Importance of microorganisms in the transformation processes of compounds that are toxic to humans and what influence climate change has on them; Influence of climate change on the spread of major diseases of microbial origin (bacteria, fungi and viruses). How climate hazards, e.g. changes in temperature and the availability of water and food affect the development of infectious diseases in humans. Climate change-dependent increase in the spread and even treatment resistance of the main pathogens (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typhoidal Salmonella).\nModule 2\nDuring the laboratory activities, students will apply techniques for bacterial isolation and enrichment of specific microbial groups (e.g., nitrogen-fixers, Actinobacteria) from different environmental matrices (e.g., soil, plants). Metabolic/enzymatic assays of the isolated bacterial strains will be performed in order to identify bacteria producing antibiotics and specific enzyme activities (e.. amylase and urease) involved in biogeochemical cycles. Finally, analysis of the soil microbiota will be performed by DNA extraction and amplification of the 16S rRNA gene that will be cloned to construct libraries in E.coli. The clone libraries will be then analyzed by molecular methods to determine the different bacterial groups present in the soil sample.\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe bibliography will be indicated during the lectures. Different basic textbooks will be suggested for the different topics, research papers and reviews will be provided during the lectures to integrate the study.\nTeaching methods\nThe teaching consists of a total of 7 CFU, divided into two modules, the first module with 4 CFU of lectures and the second module with 1 CFU of lectures preparatory to the 2 CFU of laboratory.\nAssessment methods\nThe final mark will be determined by means of a written test that will assess the achievement of the set learning objectives.\nTeaching tools\nThe lecture material presented in class will be made available to students in electronic format.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Stefano Fedi\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Martina Cappelletti"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe aim of the course is to introduce students to the main impacts of global change on coastal systems in the past, present and future. Climate changes in the geological time (and particularly in the Late Quaternary) will be taken into account for contextualizing recent/current trends in coastal behavior, and for better understanding the role of the anthropogenic component. \nKey processes interacting at different temporal and spatial scales on coastal systems and driving their dynamic evolution will be considered. The effects of global change on modern coastal systems will be discussed, with emphasis on major threats due to sea-level rise, to the occurrence of extreme events, coastal erosion and flooding. Possible mitigation and adaptation strategies, enhancing resilience and reducing vulnerability of coastal systems, are also introduced.\nCourse contents\nIntroduction to the coastal zone: definition and limits, geological heritage. Spatial and temporal scales in coastal behavior. Main hydrodynamic processes acting in the coastal zone: wind-generated waves and currents, tides and storm surges. Processes affecting sea-level at long, medium and short term. Estimates of recent local and global sea-level rise and predicted scenarios in a climate change perspective. Climate change and potential impacts at the coast: coastal vulnerability to extreme events and sea-level rise.\nCoastal systems in low-lying coasts: wave- and tide-dominated littoral systems, deltas and estuaries. Cliffed coasts and factors affecting their evolution.\nThe beach: beach sediments and transport processes; hydrodynamic and morphological profile of the beach and its short-to medium-term variations in relation with environmental factors and the seasonal wave climate.\nMain traditional and up-to-date techniques for coastal study and monitoring. Coastal erosion, natural and anthropogenic causes and possible defense policies in the view of sustainable development. Possible mitigation and adaptation strategies. The Emilia-Romagna coast as a case-study. Coastal vulnerability assessment and risk management issues.\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe main reference texts are the following:\n\nPranzini E., 2004.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course aims to clarify the meaning of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), to identify its strategic implications in terms of: sustainability of business models, need for innovative managerial paradigms based on stakeholder engagement and cooperation; measurement of the economic, social and environmental impact of company activities; life cycle assessment; strategic planning of the United Nations 2030 agenda; communication and reporting methods. The course develops the aforementioned themes with applications to companies, public administrations and non-profit organizations.\nCourse contents\nThe course is divided into two parts, closely linked and integrated: the institutional part examines the theoretical and methodological bases of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), with specific references to the international framework, to documents produced by the OECD and to relationship with social innovation. The most up-to-date methodologies for the design and development of corporate CSR and Accountability systems will be examined. Particular attention will be paid to the relationship between CSR management systems, communication and the company's external relations.\n\nThe monographic part of the course will deepen the relationships between corporate CSR, environmental sustainability and consumer demand for ethical and environmentally friendly products and services. It will also present some experiences of new services related to corporate welfare and emerging concepts of territorial social responsibility. Case studies will be presented on companies with significant and innovative experiences of CSR, capable of determining managerial evolutions and organisational improvements in the company's managerial structures and in its relationship with the market. A specific area will be dedicated to the relationship between CSR, social and environmental sustainability and circular economy.\n\nThe final part of the course will be dedicated to design corporate or territorial CSR systems capable of producing effective changes in the external perception and communication of the company. The projects developed and the experiments will be carried out with the aim of developing actions in order to closely and effectively link social and environmental sustainability of companies.\nReadings/Bibliography\nJ.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course, the student knows the basics of modern cryptography and some techniques for the analysis of security protocols. He or she can verify the absence of security bugs on simple protocols\nCourse contents\nThis course deals with some fundamental notions on modern cryptography and some techniques for the formal verification of cryptographic protocols. In addition to many new concepts, we discuss some cryptographic techniques already seen in previous courses, studying the most interesting properties . The main emphasis of this course is on the theoretical aspects of cryptography: it attempts to give a clear and accurate account on security, in order to give students the tools to assess (and not just to use) cryptographic techniques . In other words, we focus a lot on the \"why\" maybe putting the \"how\" behind the scenes. More specifically, we seek to answer questions such as the following: when a cryptographic technique can be consider safe? Is it possible to formally prove that a cryptographic technique is secure ? Is it possible to analyze the security of a cryptographic protocol in an automatic or semi-automatic way?\nTopics covered include perfect security, pseudorandomness, public and private key ciphers, and the symbolic model.\n \nReadings/Bibliography\n[1] J.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course aims at introducing the foundation of dynamical systems theory for ordinary differential equations, with a focus on chaotic dynamics.\nIt will then treat data assimilation, the term used in geoscience to refer to state estimation theory.Data assimilation encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and/or dynamical information (such as an evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. It is common practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean and environment modelling. The course will provide first the formulation of the problem from a Bayesian perspective and will then present the two popular families of Gaussian based approaches, the Kalman-filter/-smoother and the variational methods. Ensemble based methods will then be considered, starting from the well-known Ensemble Kalman filter, in its stochastic and deterministic formulations, and then the state-of-the-art ensemble-variational methods, as well as particle filters. The course will focus on the specific challenges that data assimilation has encountered to deal with high-dimensional chaotic systems, such as the atmosphere and ocean, and the countermeasures that have been taken and which have driven the recent dramatic development of the field. An overview of the nowadays and near future challenges for the discipline will conclude the course, with a focus on modern supervised machine learning methods and their use in numerical weather predictions and data assimilation.\nCourse contents\nPart I - Modelling the world: Overview on dynamical Systems and Probabilities\n● Linear Dynamics \n● Nonlinear chaos\n \t○ Linear stability analysis, invariant manifold \n \t○ Attractors (fixed points, limit cycles ...) and bifurcations\n \t○ Strange attractors, nonlinear stability, invariant manifolds\n \t○ Lyapunov vectors and exponents\n ● Stochastic dynamics\n \t○ Outlook on Probability theory and stochastic processes\nPart II - Making sense of data using models: Data Assimilation\n ● Posing the problem under a Baysiean framework\n \t○ Representation of the physical and of the observational systems\n\t○ The three estimation problems: Prediction, Filter and Smoother\n \t○ Statistical interpolation \n ● Linear estimation theory \n \t○ Gauss-Markov Models\n \t○ Observability and controllability\n \t○ Minimum variance formulation - Kalman filter and smoother\n  ○ Maximum a-posteriori formulation - Variational formalism \n \t○ Joint state-parameter estimation\n \t○ Filtering versus smoothing\n \t○ Expectation maximization\n ● Nonlinear estimation theory: the ensemble Kalman filter and 4DVar\n\t○ Minimum Variance approaches: \n  \t\t● The extended Kalman filter\n \t\t● The ensemble Kalman filter and smoother\n \t\t● Stochastic and Deterministic EnKF\n \t\t● Filter stability and divergence\n \t\t● Making the EnKF works: Inflation and localization\n● Nonlinear least squares\n ○ Gauss-Newton\n \t○ Adjoint-based minimization\n \t○ 3D- and 4D-Var\n \t○ Hybrid ensemble-variational techniques and other iterative methods\n● Fully Bayesian estimation: Particle filters\n● Data assimilation and Chaos\n Part III - Data driven data assimilation using machine learning: An Overview\n ● Data assimilation and machine learning similarities and key differences\n \t○ Estimating a model using ML\n \t○ Estimating a model using DA\n ● Combining DA and ML\n \nTeaching methods\nLectures are given in person in the classroom in hybrid modes.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThis course covers the fundamental methods in artificial intelligence to model and solve combinatorial problems requiring to take (optimal) decisions in the presence of many complex constraints. Such problems appear often in diverse domains of science, business and industry. The inherent difficulty in solving such practically crucial problems has lead to the development of Constraint Programming (CP), an intelligent decision-support technology. A growing number of companies and research institutions worldwide successfully apply CP technology and contribute to its advancement. Skills in this area are therefore in high demand in the job market. The course combines theoretical foundations with practical modelling and solving of realistic problems. At the end of the course, the student has an understanding of the advanced modelling techniques and efficient solution methods, and possesses the necessary skills for modelling in a CP language and solving with a CP solver.\nCourse contents\nPrerequisites: Basic computer science courses such as discrete mathematics, logic, algorithms and data structures, programming.

The students will be able to understand the cost of actions and inactions of climate applications to society.\nCourse contents\nThe course is the first module of the integrated course ‘Climate-related risks and commodity markets’. The course takes place in September and October. Please see here for information about the second module, 'Climate policy and commodity markets', held by Prof. Niko Jaakkola.\nThe module will cover the following topics:\n\nClimate change: the physical basis and impacts\nCarbon emission drivers; abatement strategies; investment needs\nTransition dynamics and socio-economic impacts\nClimate-related macro-financial risks; physical/financial asset stranding\nMitigation policies: carbon pricing and permit markets\nSustainable finance policy-making; central banks and financial supervisors\nClimate economic modelling: the DICE model, IAMS and CGE models\nNeoclassical transition modelling approaches\nComplexity-driven transition modelling approaches\nProduction and financial networks\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nMost of the readings will be in the form of academic articles or policy reports. All readings will be available on Virtuale or through UniBo subscriptions.\nA key reading for the course is the set of recent reports (Assessment Report 6) by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), available at this link.\nWhile there is no specific textbook for this course, interested students can we refer to:\n\nEconomides, G., Papandreou, A., Sartzetakis, E. and Xepapadeas A.

(2016) ‘Markets and the Environment’, 2nd edition, Island Press\n\nTeaching methods\nThe course will be a combination of frontal lectures, in-class exercises and student-led presentations/discussions.\nAssessment methods\nThe grade for Module I (this course) will be the combination of:\n\nParticipation (10%). This will be evaluated considering attendance and active participation to both lectures and tutorial classes.\nProblem sets (30%). Each student will submit eight problem sets during the course. Problem sets will be corrected during tutorial classes, and the deadline for submission is 23.59 of the day before the tutorial. Submission is individual, and will take place through Virtuale. Late submissions will not be accepted.\n Group-work (30%). Each student will self-allocate to a topic group (of roughly three members). Topics will be chosen among the ones provided by lecturer, but alternative topic proposals can be considered. Each group will: i) present the intermediate results of their work during tutorial classes in the second half of the course; ii) submit an essay by Sunday 5 November at 23.59 via Virtuale.\n Exam (30%). A written exam for the module will take place on 2 November, 10.00am. The exam will last 90 minutes and will include open essay-style questions, exercises and/or multiple choice questions. While this is strongly discouraged, students can decide to reject the grade obtained and try their luck with a ‘full’ exam, combining Module I and II. In this case, grades for Module I problem sets and groupwork will remain valid.\n\nThe overall grade for the integrated course will be a simple average of the grades for the two modules.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe purpose of the course is to introduce students with a background in Science to the methods and policy tools used in environmental and resource economics in order to achieve efficient management of pollution and environmental resources. More specifically, the course will introduce the concept of environmental externalities as the main source of environmental degradation, and the policy instruments used to correct these externalities. The course will also include an introduction to climate change economics and climate policy. Student having successfully completed the course are expected have a good understanding of issues and economic policies related to controlling environmental pollution and climate change.\nCourse contents\nThe first module will focus on the differences between two main approaches: environmental economics and ecological economics. Then, it will look at the economics of climate change, from different perspectives, and the social and economic consequences of climate change. \nThis module is 15 lecture hours, 7 and a half 2-hour classes.\nProgram:\n\nEnvironmental vs ecological economics\nThe limits to growth and the «biological view»\nThe economics of climate change, 1\nThe economics of climate change, 2\nOn the social and economic consequences of climate change, 1\nOn the social and economic consequences of climate change, 2\nClimate change: the recent trends. The Anthropocene debate.\n\nThe second module will begin with the introduction of environmental externalities and public goods as sources of failure of competitive markets to attain Pareto efficient market solutions. This type of market failure induces environmental regulation, which will be covered next. In this part, environmental policy instruments in theory and practice will be presented. More specifically, it will include: Command and control regulation (limits and standards); Market based instruments (emission taxes, subsidies, tradable emission permits, input taxes); and Voluntary agreements. This part will also cover bargaining solutions as a means of correcting environmental externalities (Coasian bargaining). We will next turn to a dynamic perspective emphasizing sustainable development and the conservation of different forms of capital stocks as the basis for sustainability. We will distinguish between weak and strong sustainability, and discuss how they can be measured, and we will distinguish natural, social, physical and human capital. We will next present the problems related to governing renewable and non-renewable resources, including a discussion of the Hotelling rule, the Environmental Kuznets Curve, green growth and environmental limits to economic growth.\nReadings/Bibliography\nFirst module (only).\nReading list (for those who wish to know more)\n\n1.

The student knows some examples that could be involved in applications.\nCourse contents\nPRESENTATION OF THE COURSE\n\nPolytopes are the n-dimensional analogues of (convex) polygons and polyhedra. Polytopes and their triangulations are a fundamental tool in applied mathematics, optimization and computer science; at the same time, they play a crucial role in several areas of pure mathematics, such as algebraic geometry, representation theory and combinatorics.\n\nIn this course we will discover some of the basic geometric and combinatorial properties of polytopes and of other related objects, such as hyperplane arrangements and matroids. We will provide several examples of polytopes (such as zonotopes, associahedra and permutohedra), and we will outline applications to linear optimization.\nA special focus will be on triangulation of polytopes of vector configurations: we will explore the rich combinatorics of flips and the connections with topology and algebra, together with algorithmic applications.\nWe will also deal with the problem of counting lattice points in polytopes, studying Ehrhart polynomials and their properties and sketching applications to integer optimization.\nTOPICS OF THE COURSE (REQUIRED FOR THE EXAM)\n1. Introduction to polytopes and linear optimization\nTwo ways of defining a (convex) polytope: convex hull of vertices, bounded intersection of half-spaces. First examples: simplices, cubes, regular polyhedra. Faces of a polytope; edges, facets. Linear optimization: several applications and examples. Feasible solutions and optimal solutions: connection with polytopes. Integer optimization and its applications; integer points in polytopes. Slack variables, equational form of a problem; a polytope can be expressed as an interaction of the positive orthant of R^n and of an affine subspace of R^n, for n large enough. The set of maxima of a linear functional on a polytope is a face, given by the convex hull of the vertices of the polytope that are maxima.\n\n2. Catalan combinatorics\nTriangulations of a polytope. The 2-dimensional case; Catalan numbers. Recursive and closed formula. Bijection between triangulations of a (n+2)-gon, rooted binary trees on n vertices, parenthesizations of a product of n+1 factors. Example: the triangulations of a pentagon. Flips, graph of flips of a polygon. Example: flips of the triangulations of the pentagon. The graph of flips is connected and regular of degree n-3. Extimations and bounds for its diameter.\n\n3. Polytopes arising from combinatorial data\nThe order polytope of a poset: definition, examples, main properties. Associahedra and permutohedra: definition and examples. Matroids, the basis polytope of a matroid. Examples. Generalized permutohedra. Matroids are precisely the 0/1 polytopes that are generalized permutohedra (without proof). Greedy algorithm. Theorem: matroids are precisely the families of subsets on which the greedy algorithm works for any choice of the weights.\n\n4. Polyhedral subdivisions, triangulations, regularity\nPoint configurations with labels. Definition of a polyhedral subdivision; cells, simplices, triangulations. An algorithm for producing a subdivision (and possibly a triangulation) of a point configuration. Regular polyhedral subdivisions, regular triangulations; an example of a triangulation that is not regular. Refinement; the poset of subdivisions of a given configuration. Example: the poset of regular triangulations of a configuration of five points; stratification of the space of parameters.\nThe poset of polyhedral subdivision, with respect to refinement; examples. Two lemmas. Every polyhedral subdivision can be refined to a triangulation. Every regular polyhedral subdivision can be refined to a regular triangulations. Corank 1 configurations, definition of flips (for polytopes of arbitrary dimension).\n\n5. The secondary polytope\nDefinition of GKZ vector of a triangulation; definition of the secondary polytope. Examples. Recalls on polyhedral cones and fans. The secondary fan and its properties (without proof). The secondary fan is the inner normal fan of the secondary polytope. GKZ Theorem: there is an order-preserving bijection between faces of the secondary polytope and regular polyhedral subdivisions of the point configuration.\n\n6. Ehrhart theory: the basics\nInteger points in polytopes, definition of the Ehrhart function. Theorem: the Ehrhart function is polynomial of degree the dimension of the polytope. Recalls on Moebius inversion formula. Ehrhart- Macdonald reciprocity theorem. Ehrhart quasi-polynomial, examples.\n\n7. Ehrhart theory: applications and problems\nApplications of Ehrhart theory to magic squares: semimagic squares and the Birkhoff- Von Neumann polytope, magic squares and their polytope, examples and open problems. Ehrhart polynomials of zonotopes and permutohedra. Ehrhart positivity: the Reeve's polytope, counterexamples to Ehrhart positivity for order polytopes and matroid polytopes.\nReadings/Bibliography\nWe will read a few pages from the books\n1) \"Triangulations. Structures for algorithms and applications\" by J. De Loera, J. Rambau and F. Santos.\n2) \"Computing the Continuous Discretely. Integer-Point Enumeration in Polyhedra\" by M. Beck and S. Robins\nFor applications, we will also have a look to:\n3) \"Understanding and using linear programming\" by J. Matousek, B. Gärtner\nTeaching methods\nLessons will be interactive, encouraging the participation of students. Every week a few exercises will be proposed, for a better understanding of the theory.\n\nAssessment methods\nOral exam, including exercises and proofs\n\nTeaching tools\nUsually chalk; occasionally slides, when the pictures to show are too complicated :)\n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Luca Moci"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nBy the end of the course, a student will be familiar with the main techniques for constructing geometric models on a computer, particularly with numerical methods for curves and surfaces. A successful learner can apply the discussed approaches for approximating univariate and multivariate functions and datasets, implement them within a programming environment, and critically evaluate the results.\nCourse contents\nGeometric Modeling is the branch of computational mathematics that deals with the construction of geometric models on the computer, typically for curves and surfaces. These virtual models are the basis of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software and find application, to name a few, in mechanical design, industrial design, numerical simulation (solving partial differential equations on domains with complex geometry), in rapid prototyping (eg 3D printing) and in automated production processes using numerical control machines. \nThe course aims to provide the mathematical basis of current geometric modeling techniques. In particular, the spaces of functions commonly used for the description of the geometry of objects, the computational aspects of these mathematical tools and the relative numerical methods for the construction of curves and surfaces will be presented. The theoretical discussion will be accompanied by laboratory sessions dedicated to the implementation and experimentation of the computational tools presented during the lessons. The activity in the laboratory aims to stimulate interactive learning and increase the student's degree of confidence in the application of the proposed contents.\nTopics covered during the course include: \n\n\nBernstein polinomials and Bézier curves; \nSpline functions, B-spline basis, interpolation and approximation, construction and modeling of parametric spline curves;\nNURBS (Non Uniform Rational B-splines) and related modeling techniques;\nTensor product spline and NURBS surfaces;\nMultivariate splines: splines on triangulations and related surface construction methods.\n\n\n \nReadings/Bibliography\n\nHartmut Prautzsch, Wolfgang Boehm, Marco Paluszny: Bézier an B-spline techniques; Springer 2002. \nGerald Farin: Curves and surfaces for CAGD: a practical guide; Morgan Kaufmann (5° edition), 2001. \nMing-Jun Lai, Larry L. Schumaker: Spline functions on triangulations; Cambridge University Press, 2010.\n\nOther textbooks and recent scientific articles will be recommended during the course.\nTeaching methods\nTheoretical lessons and laboratory exercises with the Matlab software. The laboratory exercises will be partly developed by the instructor and partly carried out (individually or in groups) by the students. Some of the assigned exercises will have to be completed at home to strengthen the student's level of independence towards the topic. The results of the exercises will be analyzed in the classroom and discussed during the oral exam.\nConsidering the type of activity and the teaching methods adopted, the attendance of this training activity requires the prior participation of all students in training modules 1 and 2 on safety in the study places in e-learning mode [https://elearning-sicurezza.unibo.it/?lang=en]\nAssessment methods\nThe purpose of the exam is to verify an adequate knowledge of the basic theory, a good degree of confidence with the computational tools made available during the course and the ability to critically analyze the obtained results.\nThe exam method must be agreed upon with the teacher individually at the end of the course, choosing between either one of the two following modes: \n1) Oral discussion on theory and laboratory exercises. The lab exercises must be delivered a few days before the exam.\n\n2) As an alternative to modality 1), attending students can ask to take the exam by carrying out a project that consists of implementing a MATLAB code and presenting the theory related to it. The code has to be delivered a few days before the exam. The exam consists of an oral presentation with a critical discussion of the results.\nTeaching tools\nSlides, lecture notes, software libraries. \nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Carolina Vittoria Beccari"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nUnder the threat of sea-level rise and global warming, data preserved within the recent sedimentary record are playing an increasingly important role in conservation biology practice and policy. The aim of this course is to promote understanding of how past patterns of variability can aid the development of more effective biodiversity conservation strategies and ecosystem management in the face of climate change. In this course, we will introduce elements of paleoecology, stratigraphy and paleoclimatology in order to analyze how the Quaternary record can be used to understand the ecological and environmental responses to climate changes. This course will also highlight the utility of fossils in providing a reference baseline for evaluating severity and significance of the anthropogenic impact on present-day ecosystems and their biodiversity. Methods and best practices to integrate paleontological, ecological and sedimentological data for a multidimensional view of past ecosystems are presented and discussed. Finally, the course is integrated by laboratory training on the field and will be offered an opportunity to analyze environmental dynamics in response to past climatic-eustatic perturbations directly on outcrops and/or cores.\nCourse contents\nClimate change concept; Milankovitch and sub-Milankovitch cycles; Quaternary glacio-eustatic cyclicity and Marine Isotope Stages; Stable Isotopes; Physical processes and ecosystems in coastal and marine environments; Dating methods; Basic concepts of stratigraphy and sequence stratigraphy; Marine paleoecology; Biofacies and paleobiological proxies in the Quaternary record (macrofossils); Introduction to bivariate and ordinations techniques used in natural sciences; Response of depositional environments and nearshore benthic ecosystems to Quaternary climate changes: case studies. Conservation Paleobiology.\nReadings/Bibliography\nLecture notes and bibliographic material will be provided during the course.\nTeaching methods\nLectures; Laboratory exercises and field trips.\nAs concerns the laboratory unit of this course unit, all students must attend Module 1, 2 [https://www.unibo.it/en/services-and-opportunities/health-and-assistance/health-and-safety/online-course-on-health-and-safety-in-study-and-internship-areas] online, while Module 3 on health and safety is to be attended in class.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course the student will be aware of the strategy of Green chemistry as main guideline to sustainable development in the chemical field. The student will know the principles and tool of Green Chemistry and how to assess the greenness of a chemical process, exploiting Green metrics. The student will learn some innovative green synthetic strategies and protocols safe reagents and catalysts. Among others, biocatalytic processes will be chosen as examples of important tools to be applied in the development of new chemicals and in their production. The student is expected to be able to: 1. design innovative synthetic routes and exploit alternative and benign reagents and catalysts; 2. design synthetic route tha explooit enzimes and microorganisms in place of chemicla reagents and catalysts; 3. assess the greeness of the proposed processes.\nCourse contents\nThe UC consists of three modules, with the following contents:\n(1) Green synthesis and catalysis\nApproaching chemical complexity in a sustainable manner as a mandatory issue in the organic synthesis\nFundamentals of organocatalysis and green chemistry to the evaluation of a chemical process in terms of safety and environmental impact.\nMain concepts applicable to the design of more ecological chemical syntheses, using case examples on the use of innovative reagents/catalysts, capable of replacing obsolete methodologies in organic transformations will be studied.\nApplication of innovative technology for the development of alternative synthetic pathways, improving industrial processes and producing important products.\n(2) Sustainability of biocatalytic processes\n\nBasic principles of biocatalysis: enzymatic structure, origin of activity and selectivity, kinetic models. Reaction efficiency and green chemistry metrics for biotransformations. Application of biocatalysis to sustainable industrial processes: industrial biocatalytic reactions of one and several stages. Examples of biocatalysis in industrial mass production. Cascade multi-enzymatic systems. Immobilization techniques of isolated enzymes and whole cells: advantages in the recovery of environmentally friendly products. Examples of biocatalytic processes supported in nanoscale devices and enzymatic biosensors.\n(3) “Green Metrics”\n\nThe module initially discusses the parameters traditionally used to define the efficiency of a synthetic transformation (yield, chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivity) and proceeds to the introduction of new concepts related to the sustainability and environmental performance of a chemical process (toxicity and availability of chemicals, hazardous reactions, waste production). Finally, based on Trost's definition of atomic economics, the principles of “green metrics” are applied in concrete case studies to assess in detail the efficiency of a synthetic transformation.\n\nReadings/Bibliography\n Lecture notes will be available for students.\nAdditional bibliography:\nGreen Chemistry and Catalysis (Prof. Dr. Roger Arthur Sheldon, Dr. Isabel W.

The granting of honors is taken into consideration only for those who have demonstrated an uncommon clarity of thought and a degree of knowledge of the subject much higher than the average and must be approved by both teachers of the course. \nAs a rule, the student can repeat the exam if the grade obtained does not satisfy him/her within the same academic year. In this case, only the last grade obtained can be registered even if it is lower than that received in previous attempts.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course, students will acquire knowledge on the distribution of human biodiversity all over the world and on the main adaptive processes that have influenced it by shaping patterns of phenotypic and molecular variation of human populations. In particular, it will be explored how the occupation of different and changing environments by modern humans has prompted ecological and cultural shifts that introduced novel selective pressures impacting on  the human genome. Moreover, special attention will be deserved to the discussion of cases in which ecological and cultural contexts have changed so rapidly in the modern era to trigger adaptive traits previously shaped by natural selection into maladaptive ones. Accordingly, the course will also provide to the students elements useful for the understanding of the evolutionary causes of differential susceptibilities of human populations to complex diseases.\nCourse contents\nThe course will present the main theoretical models developed so far to describe the processes by which human populations have biologically adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. Morevoer, it will describe patterns of molecular and phenotypic variation that underlie some of the most well-studied human adaptive traits. Finally, evidence supporting dis-adaptive processes undergone by present-day human populations due to rapid changes occurred in their environmental and/or cultural contexts will be presented.\nThe course contents will be organized according to the following arguments:\n1. Introduction to evolutionary principles \n\n2. Processes enabling human biological adaptation to environmental settings\n\n3.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course the student will acquire the basic notions about interacting electron systems, by discussing phenomena such as electron interactions in solids, Mott transition, superfluidity, electron-phonon interaction and elements of BCS superconductivity. He/she will also be acquainted with magnetic systems and their phase transitions.\nCourse contents\n1) Second Quantization and Second Quantized Hamiltonian\nSecond quantization is a formalism to describe quantum many-body systems. This part of the course covers the changes from the first to the second quantization formalism, and highlights the advantages and applications of the latter approach. We will introduce the second quantized Hamiltonian for the homogeneous electron gas (see point below), and we will emphasize how this formalism simplifies the treatment of interactions and facilitates the study of quantum statistics.\n2) The Homogeneous Interacting Electron Gas and Beyond\nThis section introduces the concepts of the homogeneous electron gas, a model that describes a system of electrons interacting with each other in a uniform and positive charged background. We will address its importance in condensed matter physics, investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions, and introduce the Hartree-Fock approximation used to study such systems.\n3) Electrons and Phonons\nThe understanding of the interaction between electrons and phonons (quanta of lattice vibrations) is important for explaining many physical properties of solids. This section explores a specific model to describe lattice vibrations, namely the linear chain of atoms, as well as the electron-phonon coupling. We will introduce models used to describe these interactions, such as the Fröhlich Hamiltonian. The role of the electron-phonon coupling in phenomena such as superconductivity will also be introduced.\n4) The Polaron Problem\nThe polaron problem addresses how an electron interacts and distorts the surrounding lattice, forming a quasiparticle known as a polaron. We will study the formation and behavior of polarons by using both perturbation theory and variational methods. This topic includes a discussion of different types of polarons, such as large and small polarons, and their implications for material properties.\n5) One- and two-particle Green's Functions\nGreen's functions are essential tools for studying many-body interacting systems in condensed matter physics. This section introduces the idea of Green's functions, their mathematical definition and their physical interpretation. One and two-particle Green's functions will be introduced, as well as the concept of imaginary time. We will understand how Green's functions naturally describe the propagation of particles and interactions in correlated systems, opening the door to the description of complex phenomena in realistic quantum materials.\n6) Feynman Diagrams: How to Solve the Many-Body Problem with Pictures\nFeynman diagrams give a visual and intuitive pictorial method to represent and calculate interactions in many-body systems. This part of the course explains how to build and interpret Feynman diagrams, converting mathematical expressions, that we have addressed in the previous section, into simple graphical forms. We will apply these diagrams to various problems in condensed matter physics, such as the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions.\n7) Dielectric Function and Linear Response\nThe dielectric function characterizes the response of a material to external electric fields and is important for understanding many electronic properties. In this section, we will study the theory of linear response and Kubo's formula, which describe how a system responds to weak perturbations. We will derive the dielectric function within the framework of retarded response functions and two-particle Green's functions, and explore its applications, including screening, plasmons, and the optical properties of materials. Non perturbative resummation of Feynman diagrams such as the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) will also be explored.\n8) Theory of Superconductivity\nSuperconductivity is a quantum phenomenon for which a material's electrical resistivity drops to zero below a critical temperature. This section covers the phenomenological principles and theoretical models of superconductivity. We will study the BCS theory, which accounts for the formation of Cooper pairs in the presence of electron-phonon interaction and the resulting superconducting state. If time permits, we will additionally discuss more advanced topics such as the Ginzburg-Landau theory, type-I and type-II superconductors, and recent developments in high-temperature superconductivity.\nReadings/Bibliography\nNecessary Readings\nThe only necessary bibliography consists in Lectures Notes and Slides that we will regularly upload on the Virtuale's webpage of the course.\nSuggested Readings\nThere are several classical textbooks that students interested in deepening their knowledge about certain topics can consult:\n1) \"Many-Body Quantum Theory in Condensed Matter Physics: An Introduction\" by Henrik Bruus and Karsten Flensberg.\n2) \"Quantum Field Theory for the gifted amateur\" by T. Lancaster and S. J. Bundell\n\n3) \"A Guide to Feynman Diagrams in the Many-body Problem\" by Richard D. Mattuck\n4) \"Introduction to Many-Body Physics\" by Piers Coleman\n5) \"Many-Particle Physics\" by G. D. Mahan\n6) \"A Course in Quantum Many-Body Theory\" by Michele Fabrizio\nTeaching methods\nThe teaching methods for this course are primarily based on front lectures, in order to give a high-quality delivery of the complex material we will encounter during the lectures. This approach makes sure that key concepts are clearly and systematically presented. The teaching methods include:\n1) Front Lectures\nEach topic in the syllabus will be introduced through front lectures. These lectures will give a clear and deep explanation of theoretical concepts and physical interpretations. Key points will be stressed out, and complex ideas will be addressed incrementally to facilitate the students' understanding.\n2) Blackboard and Visual Aids\nLectures will be given with visual aids such as slides that are commented and annotated on real-time (first module given by Prof. Franchini) and at the blackboard (second module by Prof. Di Sante). These visual tools will turn to be useful to illustrate the main concepts of the course, making them more accessible. Interactive demonstrations from real-time numerical simulations will also be used to show examples of correlated physical phenomena.\n4) Q&A and Discussions\nEach lecture, primarily during the first 15 minutes, will include dedicated time for questions and answers about topics of the course that have been dealt previously, providing students with the opportunity to clarify their doubts and foster discussions.\n5) Lecture Notes and Supplementary Materials\nAs already stated in \"Readings/Bibliography\" above, lecture notes and slides will be provided to accompany each lecture. These notes and slides will include all the detailed explanations, all the key equations, and all the important derivations. In addition, supplementary materials such as research papers and additional readings will also be recommended to deepen students' understanding.\n6) Homework Assignments\nHomework assignments will be given regularly on a weekly-based schedule to reinforce the material covered in lectures. Their solution is voluntary and at one's discretion. These assignments will include demonstrations of mathematical results that are not covered during the lecture for time constrains, theoretical questions, computational exercises, and practical problems. This will allow students to apply their knowledge and develop a deeper understanding of the content of the course.\nAssessment methods\nThe final exam is oral and it is designed to comprehensively assess the student's understanding of the course material. It can be taken in one of two formats:\n1) Comprehensive Questions\nStudents will answer three questions (15 minutes per question) that cover the entirety of the course content.\n2) Project Presentation\nStudents will present a project and answer questions on a topic provided near the end of the course (30 minutes). This will be followed by an additional question (15 minutes) on a topic unrelated to the project.\nAs such, for both formats, the student will have 45 minutes to complete the exam. The maximum grade that can be achieved is 30 cum laude. To pass the oral exam, the student must achieve a minimum grade of 18/30.\n\nTeaching tools\nBlackboard, Slides, Computer applications\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Domenico Di Sante\n                    \n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Cesare Franchini"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course, the student is able to account for and compare different theories that describe the starting up and organization of innovative ventures and understands the information and the analyses needed to perform a feasibility analysis and write a draft business plan for an innovative venture. The student is able to collect and analyze relevant information for that purpose, and to communicate a feasibility analysis/business plan orally and in writing.\nCourse contents\nThe course focuses on the development of entrepreneurial behaviours in a variety of settings. In particular, it presents the fundamentals of developing an effective business plan, teaching the basic principles of developing plans for the sales, marketing, product or service operations, financials and management of a new venture. It assumes some prior knowledge of the subject area and will equip students with much of the knowledge required to launch and manage a high potential new venture. \n\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe following textbook is needed for a clear comprehension of the topics presented during the course:\nPreparing Effective Business Plans: An entrepreneurial approach. Bruce Barringer, 2014, Pearson New International Edition, 1st Edition, ISBN-13: 978-1-292-03991-6 \n\nAlongside this textbook, a series of slides, case studies, problems and exercises will also be presented throughout the course. \nTeaching methods\nStudents are encouraged to attend all classes. The course is designed so to stimulate class interaction and discussion. Most of the insights will emerge during class hours rather than as a result of a simple reading of the required teaching material. A deep understanding of cases and exercises can only be achieved through the class discussion and interaction between students and the instructor.\n\nSome sessions are dedicated to case studies and in-class exercises. Students are invited to read carefully the content of each case/exercise in advance. This will help to better understand the theoretical concepts presented in class and to raise proper questions to successfully solve the case/exercise.\n\n\nAssessment methods\nAssessment will be based on a team coursework (up to 5 students per team).\n\nEach team will be assessed on:\ni. A final written business plan of 5,000 words plus exhibits (70% of the coursework)\nii. A 10-minute presentation (max 12 slides), followed by a 7-minute questions and answers (30% of the coursework)\n\n\nTeaching tools\nDuring the course some slides will be video projected in the classroom. They will be downloadable from the following website https://virtuale.unibo.it/. The material is password protected; both user name and passwords will be communicated to students during the first day of class. \n\nSome case studies, problems and exercises will also be presented throughout the course. Students will be able to download the texts from the same website. Solutions will be posted after the class. The material related to the week class will be posted on the website in advance. \n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Riccardo Fini"

Novel quantum technologies, based on the quantum principles of superposition and entanglement, are emerging in a number of sectors, namely communication, computing, sensing and measuring. Most of them are based on the use of quantum materials, namely materials which display collective quantum phenomena, also called emergent phenomena, emerging from the many-body interaction of different physical entities such as spin, charge, phonon, orbital…\nMagnetic and superconducting materials are among the prototypes of quantum materials for most prominent quantum technologies, such as quantum computing and sensing. These technologies often make use of magnetic resonant techniques for the manipulation of the quantum states. \nIn this course a basic introduction to magnetism and superconductivity and to magnetic resonant techniques is provided by combining theoretical and experimental/phenomenological approach.\n  \nMAGNETISM\n-> Introduction:\nmagnetic moments and quantum mechanics; the coupling of two spins.\n-> Isolated magnetic moments:\nHamiltonian of an isolated atom in a magnetic field; Larmor diamagnetism; paramagnetism and Brillouin theory; the Curie law vs. ground state of ions and their fine structure; comparison with experiments and Crystal field contribution; Van Vleck Paramagnetism.

The typical duration of the exam is 45 minutes.\nThe purpose of the oral exam is to verify the student's knowledge and his/her ability to apply it and to make the necessary logical-deductive connections. \nGraduation of the final grade: Preparation on a very limited number of topics covered in the course and analytical skills that emerge only with the help of the teacher, expression in overall correct language → 18-19; \nPreparation on a limited number of topics covered in the course and autonomous analysis skills only on purely executive issues, expression in correct language → 20-24; \nKnowledge of a large number of topics addressed in the course, ability to make independent choices of critical analysis, proper use of specific terminology → 25-29; \nSubstantially exhaustive preparation on the topics covered in the course, ability to make independent choices of critical analysis and connections, full mastery of the specific terminology and ability to argue and critical thinking → 30-30L\nTeaching tools\nBlackboard, overhead projection.\nLinks to further information\nhttps://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/s.sanna/contenuti-utili/6575e556\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Samuele Sanna"

Information about Module 3 attendance schedule is available on the website of your degree programme.\n\nAssessment methods\nThe student will be allowed to face the examination only if in possession of documented attendance of the practical lessons (75% of the total).\nLaboratory part: the assessment of the learning outcomes of the student is performed by means of an oral presentation regarding the laboratory experience with duration of 20 min. max. During the presentation the student will have to comment on the laboratory experience, with particular emphasis on the spectral characterization of the products obtained and the problems encountered during the experience. The teacher will ask questions aimed at establishing the knowledge acquired by the student.\nTheoretical part: The assessment of the learning outcomes of the student is performed at the end of the course by means of oral examination with duration of 30 min. The oral examination generally begins with the structural analysis of one title molecule recently appeared in the literature. The student will be asked to propose a possible synthetic sequence for its preparation. Main disconnections will be related to the reactivity discussed during the course. \n The final mark of the exam will be expressed in 30th and it will derive for the assessment of the oral exam (max: 23/30), the presentation related to the module of Laboratory (max 8/30) and personal assessment of the candidate during the working time in the laboratory classes (2/30). Laude could be assigned in case of exceptional preparation and with a final and total mark not less than 32.\nTeaching tools\nThe didactic material will be provided by the Professor to the students in electronic format. Moreover, all the literature articles describing the exercises discussed during the class-room will be available. All in one, the students will be asked to prepare the examination by studying notes taken during the classes.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Marco Bandini\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Andrea Gualandi"

In particular, students are able to implement algorithmic strategies for challenging imaging applications, by combining optimization and machine learning tools, and to critically evaluate the numerical results.\nCourse contents\nThe course offers a computational view of Imaging problems through both Variational Methods and Machine Learning techniques. The image processing applications that will be covered range from image deblurring and denoising, to inpainting and super-resolution, to segmentation and classification for the extraction of meaningful information/structures, to reconstruction from different imaging modalities (e.g., Computed Tomography, CT) in biomedicine and geophysics.\nThe course covers the entire chain of resolution of Imaging problems, that is problem identification → modeling and discretization → analysis → numerical optimization / Machine Learning approach.By the end of the course, students will be able to tackle mathematical and Machine Learning problems for Imaging with a new repertoire of numerical cutting-edge tools.In particular, at the end of the course, students will have achieved the following learning objectives:\n\nProblem identification: identification of Imaging problems as inverse operator problems (for example, integral equations);\nModeling and discretization: formulation of problems occurring in imaging applications through linear and nonlinear variational methods; use of Bayesian modeling to account for data and model uncertainty; continuous versus discrete modeling;\nAnalysis: understanding of the main concepts of linear and nonlinear regularization theory and how it affects the existence and uniqueness of solutions;\nNumerical optimization: numerical solution of large-scale, convex and non-convex, differentiable and non-differentiable, constrained and unconstrained optimization problems;\nMachine Learning approach: basic introduction to Machine Learning and some of its underlying mathematics; Machine Learning in the context of inverse Imaging problems; convolutional neural networks (CNN), learning and post-processing priors, learned iterative optimization schemes.

The laboratory exercises will be partly guided by the teacher, partly solved by the students (either individually or in groups). The results of the exercises will be analyzed during the lessons and (possibly) discussed by the students during the final oral exam.\nGiven the type of activity and teaching methods adopted, the attendance of this course requires the prior participation of all students in the training modules 1 and 2 on safety in the study places ( https://elearning-sicurezza.unibo.it/ ) in e-learning mode.\nAssessment methods\nThe final exam consists of the oral discussion on the theoretical part and 3 project assignments carried out during the labs.\nThe final exam aims to verify the achievement of the following learning objectives:- student's ability to solve application problems requiring knowledge of advanced numerical tools - both theoretical and computational - such as, in particular, ill-posed inverse problems for signal/image processing, numerical optimization problems;- student's ability to critically analyze the results obtained from the implemented programs, in the light of the theoretical knowledge acquired during the course.\nTeaching tools\nSlides and notes from the teachers, and other material (Matlab source codes, etc.).

These reactions are being intensely studied in the organic, inorganic and metal-organic fields, as mechanochemistry can promote reactions between solids quickly and quantitatively, with either no added solvent or only nominal amounts, thus reducing environmental impact and costs.\nThe need to develop new green and sustainable methods and processes for “a chemistry benign by design” is pushing scientists in both academia and industry to approach chemistry differently, using safer reagents or solvents, diminishing the generation of toxic and non-toxic waste, and limiting solvent use, hence the energy costs of their disposal after use.\nThe course will provide a broad but digestible overview of the state-of-the-art of mechanochemical syntheses, and present opportunities and challenges of a whole sector of synthetic chemistry with current and potential environmentally friendly applications in the agrochemistry, food and pharmaceutical fields, as well for the preparation of discrete and extended metal–organic systems for gas storage, filtering and detecting, among others.\nThe course will also touch upon industrial aspects and possibility of scaling up laboratory-born mechanochemical reactions, such as liquid assisted grinding, resonant acoustic mixing etc., intermediate gas activation, sonochemistry, seeding-assisted grinding, planetary-milling liquid assisted, dry milling, vortex grinding.\nThe following topics will be discussed with the online participation of guest researchers with experience on specific topics.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe rationale of this course is to illustrate and provide an overview of the role deformation plays in both the genesis and spatial distribution of ore deposits. This will be done by combining traditional class lectures and lab style exercises with seminar-style classes based on reading and student presentations and a few days directly at the outcrop. This combined approach will allow students to develop theoretical and practical skills related to asking and assessing scientific questions as well as summarizing and presenting the results of scientific studies dealing with the role exerted by rock deformation and fluid/rock interaction in deformed contexts. The course will review the concepts, theoretical knowledge and techniques of Structural Geology that are relevant to understanding ore genesis and exploration of ore deposits. It will also provide hands-on field work to help strengthen the theoretical knowledge and provide the students with a solid understanding of the involved mechanisms and processes. Students will thereby learn the simple principles of “Structural Control” and how to elaborate the best practices for structural data collection and analysis in mineral exploration and mining.\nCourse contents\nThe course will elaborate on the main following topics:\n- Summary of fundamentals: deformation, stress and strain, porosity and permeability, brittle and ductile regimes, kinematic and dynamic approach to deformation. Structural geology mapping, data collection and observations, structural data analysis and interpretation; unravelling the 3D geometry of structures;\n- Faults and fault-related structures; fault core vs. damage zone; permeability changes along and across fault zones; basic elements of discrete fracture modelling.\n- Shear zones and ductile deformation;\n- Folds and related structures;\n- Structurally-controlled fluid flow and mineralizations.\nField lab activities will permit to apply the theoretical knowledge to specific real-case scenarios. \nReadings/Bibliography\nScientific papers and references to parts of specific textbooks will be indicated to the students during the course.\nThere is no such thing as a single tetxbook to recommend and prescribe.\nTeaching methods\nFrontal lectures will be kept to the minimum, with students being involved in seminarial activities, hands-on practical exercises and fieldwork. A 5-day field trip to the Island of Elba and southern Tuscany will expose students to outstanding examples of hydrothermal deposits. Fieldwork will be used to unravel and constrain the genetic relationships between brittle deformation, fluid ingress and flow and ore genesis.\nGiven that students will be spending a significant amount of their time out in the field, it is compulsory for them to attend the e-learning modules 1 and 2 on safety matters (https://www.unibo.it/it/servizi-e-opportunita/salute-e-assistenza/salute-e-sicurezza/sicurezza-e-salute-nei-luoghi-di-studio-e-tirocinio) as well as module 3, which is specific on safety in the specific environments wherein the course field laboratories will be held. Information as to where and when module 3 will be held can be obtained from the coordinator of the Curriculum.\nAdditionally, an evaluation of the general physical conditions of the students has to be carried out by one of the University doctors (https://corsi.unibo.it/laurea/ScienzeGeologiche/formazione-obbligatoria-su-sicurezza-e-salute).\nAssessment methods\nDifferent assessment methods will be used to evaluate the students: content-based, competence-based and impact-based assessments. Content-based assessment refers to assessment tasks that mainly ask the learner about facts. Competence-based assessment refers to assessment of intended learning outcomes that ask the student to show ability to also use these facts. Impact-based assessments take the assessment of competencies one step further and ask the student to use these competencies in a real-life situation to create a change or solve a challenge. Grades in the Italian university system are expressed out of thirty. The passing grade is 18/30. In case of full grade (30/30) the professor(s) may also decide to award honours (lode).\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Giulio Viola\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Francesco Giuntoli"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThis course mainly focuses on the evaluation and monitoring of ecosystem changes related to human impact and global change. Particular emphasis will be given to: 1) the ecological mechanisms driving the main ecosystem functions, including energy flow and chemical cycling; 2) the founding basics on species population- and community-levels in relation to ecosystem functions; 3) the main modelling techniques used to monitor spatial changes of ecological properties; 4) the use of remote sensing for evaluating ecosystem changes at wide spatial extents. The course includes practical analysis of spatial data making use of free and open source software (R, GRASS GIS). Students will finally be able to create their own project on monitoring of spatial and temporal changes of ecosystems at different spatial scales.\nCourse contents\nLab plan:\n\n1.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe aim of this course is to provide knowledge on process and Quaternary geomorphology, with a focus on mountain environments. The course examines aspects of sediment supply and sediment transfer, including hillslope-channel interactions,  the role of hydro-meteorogical forcing on the intensity and typology geomorphic transport processes. It also deals with sediment management in the Anthropocene, including the impacts of in-channel engineering infrastructures and landcover changes. Sediment yield and sediment storage in natural and regulated systems are also discussed, as well as the role of Pleistocene glaciations on the present spatial organization of geomorphic processes and sediment fluxes. In this context, the course further examines dating landforms and constraining denudation rates at millennial time scales. The lab-based component introduces students to expert-based mapping of sediment sources and channel changes, as well as glacial and periglacial landforms on remotely-sensed images to build georeferenced databases for geo-hazard assessment. The field-based component illustrates techniques for field-based mapping, characterizing channel bed texture, as well as monitoring water and sediment fluxes. The discussion is fostered by a literature review on selected topics that will vary from year to year. Finally, analysis of data collected in the field is performed by groups of students, in peparation of a short technical report.\nCourse contents\nThe course will be taught by Francesco Brardinoni (University of Bologna), with guest lectures given by Prof. Marwan Hassan (University of British Columbia), and by other foreign faculty members.\nAttendance is limited to a maximum of 12 students due to logistical and security reasons linked to fieldwork activities scheduled for the course.\nSelection of the candidates will be based on:\n1 - Student's grades in exams related to geomorphology, hydrology and GIS. Students who have conducted their own undergraduate thesis in similar topics are particularly encouraged to apply.\n2 - A short and informal interview that aims at exploring student's: (i) skills in English comprehension and communication; (ii) motivation/interest in working in hillslope and fluvial geomorphology.\nThe short and informal interview will take place via Teams in the first week of March (date to be determined).\nStudents wishing to attend the course are kindly asked to send an email message to francesco.brardinoni@unibo.it to set up an appointment in person with me in person.\nThe course will be offered in the form of a compact summer school, with five 2-hour weekly meetings starting in April 2025, followed by a 5 consecutive days of practical activities (a week between the second half of June and the first hald of July 2025 - actual dates are yet to be decided to avoid overlapping with other field camps).\nTOPICS will include: landslide mapping, landslide sediment delivery to stream channels, channel morphology, hydraulic geometry, channel bed texture, particle tracking, sediment transport, historical anthropogenic impacts on mountain drainage basins and basin-scale sediment management. Depending on the class interests, on contingent logistics and climatic conditions, field activities may be conducted either in the Alps or in the Apennines, with emphasis on different geomorphic themes.\n\nACTIVITIES include lectures in class, one-day field excursion, 3-day field data collection, 2-day field data analysis and oral presentation of the results. Field activities will take place in the Sillaro River basin.

Modern techniques of astronomical data analysis will be acquired by the student, along with the capability of presenting and discussing professionaly the results of the\nanalysis of measurements taken during the course.\nCourse contents\nThe course is divided into two main parts: frontal lessons and data analysis and interpretation.The first part comprises some introductory lessons on the detection of astronomical signals and general concepts (background, SNR, PSF), then it focuses on specific, wavelength-dependend topics and issues, preparatory for the subsequent data analysis. For what concerns data analysis and interpretation, there are three lab courses, each one focusing on topics at different wavelengths: radio [low (VLA) and high (ALMA) frequency), optical/near-IR, and X-ray/Gamma-ray/TeV. All students will attend these three lab courses. Each lab comprises lessons, tutorials, and hands-on training on data reduction, analysis and interpretation. Students will be divided into groups and each group will work on a specific scientific project. In the following a non-exhaustive list of general and specific topics is reported:\n\nDetection of astronomical signals. Transmission of the electromagnetic radiation through the atmosphere. \n\n\nBackground and its treatment in astronomical data analysis. \n\n\nPSF and signal-to-noise ratio concepts. \n\n\nPhotometry: photometric systems, calibration, aperture and PSF-fitting photometry.\n\n\nSpectroscopy of different classes of sources (stars, galaxies, and AGN).\n\n\nKinematics: measure of radial velocity and redshift from observed spectra. \n\n\nProperties of telescopes in different bands. \n\n\nExposure time calculators.\n\n\nExcursus on the properties of the main modern telescopes and future facilities.\n\n\nData analysis in the optical/near-IR. \n\n\nInterferometry: main concepts, and analysis of interferometric radio (VLA) and sub-millimeter data (ALMA).\n\n\nAnalysis of high-energy data of nearby and high-redshift active galaxies, and interpretation of the results using state-of-the-art physical models.\n\n\nHigh-energy detectors: how to use them and data acquisition.\n\n\nHigh-energy properties of the AGN: open issues.\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nDetectors for high-energy astrophysics & X-ray data analysis\n\nGlenn F.

Students will be divided into working groups (typically, comprising 3 people each); each group is assigned a specific scientific project and specific datasets which will be analyzed using the most up-to-date techniques (widely explained in the tutorials). Discussions with teachers and experts of the field are a fundamental part of these labs. \nThe structure of the course is though to provide students with the capabilities of working as a team, reading and understanding scientific papers, and discuss their results using written reports (radio/sub-mm lab course) and powerpoint presentations (optical and X-ray lab courses). \nAll of the students must attend the frontal lessons and the lab experiences, including tutorials. For what concerns the radio/submm laboratory, half of the students will attend the VLA lab (low frequency) and the remaining half the submm lab (high frequency).\nIn consideration of the type of activity and the adopted teaching methods (e.g., use of computer), the attendance of this training activity requires the prior participation of all students in the training modules 1 and 2 (formazione sulla sicurezza nei luoghi di studio) in e-learning mode [https://elearning-sicurezza.unibo.it].\nAssessment methods\nThe exam is structured as follows: \n\nFor what concerns the radio/(sub)-mm lab course, each group will write a final report. Professors will provide comments (on timescales that will be communicated during the course) and will verify the knowledge in the radio/submm bands acquired by the students during the frontal lessons and the lab course. \nFor what concerns the optical/near-IR and X-ray/Gamma-ray lab courses, each group will prepare a powerpoint presentation to be presented at the end of the lab courses (precise dates will be defined later in the course). Each student will discuss a part of the powerpoint presentation (\"who is presenting what\" being decided by the professors). \n\nScores will depend on the quality of the presentations and on the students' capability in hard working (in data analysis and interpretation) during the lab courses.\nTo be more specific: each lab assigns an evaluation, corresponding to an interval of scores. Students, at the end of the three partial examinations, can then decide either to accept the grade (expressed in the 30-scale) resulting from the three-lab evaluations, or to have a final oral examination; in this case, the student, in practice, renounces the grade assigned by the three labs.\nIt is strongly suggested that students already attended and possibly take the AGN & SMBH exam.\nTeaching tools\nPowerpoint presentations and blackboard.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Cristian Vignali\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Alessio Mucciarelli\n                        \n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Paola Grandi\n                        \n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Rosita Paladino\n                        \n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Myriam Gitti"

Mnemonic knowledge of the course topics or not completely appropriate terminology will be valued with intermediate rankings. Unknown topics or inappropriate terminology use will be valued, depending on the seriousness of the omissions, with minimal or insufficient rankings.\n\nWith regard to the project report, a critical analysis of the problem and the proposed solution(s) as well as a proper evaluation of the proposed solution(s) are required to get maximum rankings.The exam consists of an oral colloquium on the course contents designed to evaluate the critical skills and methodological knowledge gained by the student.\n\n\nThe date for the exam can be arranged by appointment contacting the teacher.

The test questions concern all the course topics: questions may be purely conceptual and theoretical, or they may imply a reasoning connected to the rapid performing of short exercises. \nIt is an open-book test; mobile phones and internet connection are prohibited. Students with specific learning disorders, special educational needs or disabilities can make use of all their compensatory and dispensatory aiding tools. \nThe test total time, including, in particular, its illustration by the teacher, does not generally exceed 90 minutes (120 minutes maximum).\n\n\nThe grade obtained in the Numerical Analysis module exam contributes to forming the arithmetic mean with the grade obtained in the Computational Statistics module exam: such a mean represents the overall grade of the Numerical Analysis  integrated course.\nIn the event of COVID-19 indications and the like, the assessment method may have to vary: in this case, students will be notified in advance and, in any case, during the lectures; in this case, moreover, the assessment procedures will be published in the teacher's NEWS and in the note contained in each exam enrolling list in Almaesami.\nTo take part in the exam, it is compulsory to register in the relative Almaesami list, remembering that the lists close a few working days before the exam.\nTeaching tools\nCourse notes and material to study and exercise available at the Virtuale platform (https://virtuale.unibo.it) and text books available at the departmental libraries.\nLinks to further information\nhttps://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/giulia.spaletta/news\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Giulia Spaletta"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course, the student will know: - the main results obtained by Physics Education Research regarding the conceptual, epistemological, linguistic and educational knots related to the teaching and learning of upper secondary school physics topics (e.g. thermodynamics, electromagnetism, relativity, quantum physics); - teaching tools and methodologies developed by Physics Education Research and within the History of Physics, also with respect to the role of the teacher and the teaching choices that can be made; - methods for monitoring and analysing the processes of teaching/learning physics. The student will be able to: - analyse research materials (questionnaires and transcripts of audio- and video- recording) concerning emblematic moments of learning; - use various texts and materials for designing teaching/learning experiences (textbooks, original papers, historical and epistemological texts, research papers in physics education research, popular science books, web-sites, and so on); - analyse innovative proposals for teaching physics at the secondary school level; - apply instructional methodologies and technologies to design teaching paths and experiences in relation to physics topics foreseen by the Italian syllabus for secondary schools.\nThe course will be in Italian and Italian language is needed for examination.\nCourse contents\nThe course will address the following topics:\n- Physics Education as research field: the origins, the constructivist paradigm, the research on students' knowledge, models of conceptual change (from the model of Posner, Strike, Henson and Herzog to the coordination classes by A. diSessa);\n- The teaching of Special Relativity: students' difficulties on the concepts of event, frame of reference, relativity of simultaneity, proper time, length contraction; Einstein's and Minkowski's approaches compared from an educational perspective; the debate on the concepts of space and time in physics as example of the contribution that history and epistemology can provide to physics teaching/learning;\n- The teaching of Thermodynamics: students' difficulties on the concepts of temperature, heat, internal energy, entropy; macroscopic and microscopic approaches compared from an educational perspective; thermodynamics as an example to design inclusive learning environments; the construct of appropriation and orchestration strategies;\n- The teaching of Quantum Physics: students' difficulties on the old quantum physics; analysis of results in History and Foundation of Physics and of their “didactical transposition”; interdisciplinary between mathematics and physics; the role of metaphors in teaching/learning quantum physics at the secondary school level.\nTexts of different nature (e.g.: sections from school textbooks, research articles, historical-epistemological essays, research materials) will be analysed in order to become familiar with the various aspects of Physics Education: the conceptual/disciplinary, the cognitive, the epistemological, the educational practical ones.\nDuring the course a special attention will be paid to analyze and discuss the following transversal themes:\n- gender issues in teaching/learning physics;\n- science & society;\nand the following transversal competences will be developed:\n- critical thinking;\n- competences of team-working;\n- communication skills.\nThe course will be in Italian and Italian language is needed for examination.\nReadings/Bibliography\nTeaching materials will be uploaded on a shared folder and made available on the Moodle platform of the course.\nThe materials include slides and presentations, research articles and other materials for study (e.g.: tutorials, guides for group activities, research tools, students' protocols, etc.).\nThe following text is suggested for deeper study of the course topics:\nBesson U. (2015), Didattica della fisica, Carocci.\nTeaching methods\nThe course is designed as to illustrate a large variety of educational methods.\nStudents will experience on themselves different types of lesson (socratic/dialogical vs. academic lectures), micro teaching activities, peer-to peer evaluation, cooperative learning, group work supported by tutorials.\nSince interactive teaching methods will be implemented, attendance at lessons is strongly recommended.\n\nAssessment methods\nThe exam consists of an oral task divided into two parts.\n\nPart I\n- presentation and discussion of a research article in Physics Education, selected from a list made available. The presentation of the analysis must contain a critical reflection on: i) the research problem addressed; ii) the research method used; iii) results; iv) implications for teaching.\n\nPart II\n- Discussion about concepts or topics addressed in the course both from a disciplinary and an educational point of view.\nThe first part of the exam will assess student's ability to:\n1) understand the approach, contents and results of the article (up to 10 points);\n\n2) understand the structure and methodological aspects (up to 10 points);\n\n3) elaborate and reflect critically on the implications of the article (up to 10 points).\nThe second part of the exam will evaluate:\n1) the level of comprehension of a concept or topic addressed during the course (up to 15 points);\n2) the ability to analyze such a concept or topic from an educational perspective, that is the ability to recognize what aspects of the concept/topics are problematic for understanding (up to 10 points);\n3) the ability to situate the discussion of this theme or concept within a wider cultural and educational perspective and/or within a teaching path (up to 5 points).\nThe final mark will be the average between the points obtained in the first and in the second part of the exam.\nFor the students who can not attend classes, the assessment methods will be different. There is a guided plan for reading and analyzing texts and teaching materials. The reading and analysis plan will lead to the production of written reports, that are preparatory to an oral examination. The methods are described in detail in the proper folder that is uploaded to the platform at the beginning of the course. NON-attending students are asked to contact the teacher.\nTeaching tools\nPower-point presentations, educational movies, web-sites, tools embedded in Virtuale (e.g wooclap or forum).\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Olivia Levrini\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of"

At the end of the course, the students are aware of the multifaceted, multidisciplinary nature of development and globalization processes and are familiar with the main approaches and theories to the study of development. They know and are able to take stances in several debates (International political economy literature) relative to the following nexuses: growth-development, institutions-development, social capital-development, war-development, multilateralism-development, inequality-development.\nCourse contents\nThis graduate course is articulated in two parts. In the first part the main theories and approaches to the study of development as a multidimensional concept and practice are covered, with particular reference to the IPE and CPE literatures, through the deepening of specific aspects of the politics-development nexus (political institutions-development, social capital-political culture-development, regime transition-development).\nIn the second part of the course current debates and empirical cases are discussed, in light of theories and concepts examined in Part I, with specific reference to the interaction between aid and development, inequality and development, global shocks and development. A special attention is devoted to the roles played by state and non-state actors in the construction and redefinition of global economic governance structures and processes, with a focus on development finance. \nPart 1\nCONCEPTS AND THEORIES\n1.The political economy of development, and the evolution of economic development as a policy objective\n2.Development and Dependency\n3.

Plagiarism voids the exam, and is brought before Unibo competent offices. \nThe oral exam is articulated through three questions, suggested by the Professor, aimed at testing the student's ability to verbally articulate themes and methods discussed in class, offering the student the opportunity to show her/his ability to critically reassess such material.\nNon-attending students\nStudent who choose not to attend classes will have to cover the same topics and prepare the same readings indicated in the program above (not including class discussions, debates, visual material), and posted through Virtuale.\nNon-attending students will also have to submit an essay, following the same guidelines indicated for attending students (see above).\nIn addition, they will have to prepare in full the following text:\n- Baroncelli, E. (2019) The European Union, the World Bank and the Policymaking of Aid. Cooperation among Developers, London, Routledge.\nEvaluations for non-attending students will be based on 1. their short essay (worth 50% of the final grade) and on 2. their final oral exam (worth 50% of the final grade). Similar to attending students, non-attending students are required to download study guidelines for the written material assigned, page references and assigned readings as posted through Virtuale. They are not required to prepare on visual materials shown in class/class debates and discussions.\n \nAssessment criteria for both oral and written exams, attending and non-attending students\nThe ability of the student to achieve a coherent and comprehensive understanding of the topics addressed by the course, to critically assess them and to use an appropriate language will be evaluated with the highest grades (A = 27-30 con lode).A predominantly mnemonic acquisition of the course's contents together with gaps and deficiencies in terms of language, critical and/or logical skills will result in grades ranging from good (B = 24-26) to satisfactory (C = 21-23). A low level of knowledge of the course’s contents together with gaps and deficienciesin terms of language, critical and/or logical skills will be considered as ‘barely passing' (D = 18-20) or result in a fail grading (E).\n \nTeaching tools\nTaught classes and class discussions-debates are held with the support of audio-visual tools (ppt, web and non-web footages). Interactive tools and inclusive teaching are also employed to enhance class participation.\nEssay writing training & clinics (teaching + Virtuale posts + abstract supervision/approval).\nStudents with a form of disability or specific learning disabilities (DSA) who are requesting academic adjustments or compensatory tools are invited to communicate their needs to the teaching staff in order to properly address them and agree on the appropriate measures with the competent bodies.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Eugenia Baroncelli"

All the projects will be made available to other students as part of the course material in the Moodle repository on-line space.\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe course will made ample use of the text:\nH. Peng, X. Sun, W. Weng, X. Fang “Polymer Materials for Energy and Electronic Applications”, Academic Press, 1st ed., 2017\nwhich is intended as a suggested lecture.\nA copy of the book will be available in the Department’s library for student’s reference.\nAll the lectures slides will be made available to the students prior every lecture (usually the day before) on the on-line Moodle repository, a direct link to which can be found in the on-line page of the present course. Students that officially choose the course can automatically access the materials with UniBo ID. If students find problems in accessing the on-line Moodle repository they can contact the teacher to solve the issue.\nScientific papers of outstanding importance discussed along the course, together with the material gathered by the students within projects development, will be made available once again in a dedicated room within the on-line Moodle repository of the course.\nThe projects developed by the students will be also made available to other students by the end of the semester, after careful revision from the teacher.\nTeaching methods\nThe course will be mainly held as room lectures with the help of Power Point Presentations. The lectures will be also streamed on TEAM for the students unable to be present due to the COViD-19 emergency and restraints. More up to date information on the situation is available here. During the course students will be encouraged to enter active class discussion about open issues within the course development. Students participation and active suggestions will be addressed and followed.\nStudents will also be offered the opportunity to develop a project about a subject of choice belonging to the syllabus. The project is not compulsory. The development of the project, that has to approach a problem (previously discussed and agreed upon with the teacher) and provide the students perspective on it based on literature survey and open class discussion, will be part of the final mark evaluation (30%) and will be offered public audience, as part of the final lectures. All the projects will be also made available to other students as part of the course material in the Moodle repository on-line space.\nAssessment methods\nAfter completing the course, the student should be able to:\n\nEvaluate structures and properties of polymers for electronics\nAssess the functionality of different polymers in different aspects of electronic applications\nNavigate the structural/functional properties of composites and nanocomposites in terms of environmental applications\n\nLearning assessment is based on oral examination at the end of the course and, in the case the students choose it, on the project they developed and presented during the course. The oral exam will be made of three questions: the first one will be on a subject chosen from the student among the ones from the syllabus.  In the case students will choose to develop and present their project, the first question will be considered already done. In this first case the mark will be 100% based on the final oral examination outcome, in the case the student choose to participate in the project 30% of the final mark will be based on the project (ability in approaching the problem of choice, evaluation of the literature and quality of the final presentation) that has to be held during the semester, while the remaining 70% of the mark will be based on the final oral examination.\nIn order to attend the final examination, students must register online within the given deadlines (registration usually closes one day before the exam date). The oral examination will last about 20 to 30 minutes.\nTeaching tools\nRoom lectures with the aid of power point presentation. The presentations will be available on line on Moodle repository platform before the lectures.\nAdditional material for reference will also be made available on Moodle repository platform.\nStudents with DSA or disabilities can contact Servizio Studenti con Disabilità e DSA dell’Università di Bologna (website in Italian only, but they will answer in english when contacted via mail), the Department contact person (Prof. Giorgio Bencivenni, giorgio.bencivenni2@unibo.it) or directly the teacher to address the most convenient approach for accessing teaching materials and supports, and to gain access to all the convenient services and areas of the Departments (i.e. room for frontal lectures).\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Laura Mazzocchetti"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the activity, the student acquires familiarity with the professional techniques of presentation and critical discussion of scientific problems. The student understands how to organize a multi-media presentation of a research topic in Astrophysics and Cosmology, how to present and discuss the physical basis of a problem, the state-of-the-art of the research in that sector, the novelty of the results, their impact on that specific problem and the possible weaknesses.\nCourse contents\nThis course is meant to provide a solid basis for presentation of scientific results. To this goal, students will decide a subject of interest (unrelated to the main topic of their master thesis), and the professor will provide a list of papers/review articles on that topic, besides the scientific support for a better understanding of the articles. The student will then choose one of the proposed articles and present (a) the scientific rationale/background (i.e., open questions in that field) and (b) the main outcomes (and how they were obtained) using a powerpoint presentation. It is suggested to contact the professor well in advance compared to the thesis defence. \nReadings/Bibliography\nBibliography will be suggested once the main topic for the professional skills is defined. \nTeaching methods\nTeaching will be focused on specific topics (related to the subject chosen by the student) which are not sufficiently clear (or appear too challenging) on the basis of the academic courses of the Laurea Magistrale in Astrophysics and Cosmology.\nAssessment methods\nStudents' knowledge in the chosen field will be evaluated through a powerpoint presentation (20 min). Relevance in the final evaluation will be given to the capability of presenting the scientific background, data/simulations of the chosen article, results and, possibly, future perspectives, with a critical and scientific attitude.\nTeaching tools\nPowerpoint presentations.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Cristian Vignali"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThis course provides a wide-ranging survey of conceptual foundations and issues in contemporary public law and human rights law. The purpose of the first part of the course is to provide students the ability to understand the functioning of the State, its policies and their concrete applications, even managing to understand the real meaning of the institutional changes and their weight in the legal order. The second part of the course will be dedicated to the study of the means of protection of human rights, in the national as well as in the international and European context. This course explores major features of human rights' protection through close examination of selected decisions of the Italian Constitutional Court, the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. A special focus will be dedicated to the study of cultural rights and of the rights of immigrants both in the National and in the European context.\nCourse contents\nIn the first part of the course the students will study the bases of international human rights law .\n\nThere will be a special focus on means of protection of human rights, with particularly reference to the different regional contexts: the European Human Rights System; the Inter-American Human Rights System; the African Human Rights System; the not completely evolved Arab and Asian Human Rights Systems.\n\nThis course explores major features of human rights' protection and there will be a close examination of selected decisions of international and supranational Courts.\n\nIn the last part of the course a special focus will be dedicated to the study of Environmental rights and sustainable development; cultural rights and rights of immigrants.\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe students that will NOT attend the lessons shall prepare\n Rhona K. M. Smith, International human rights law, Oxford, last ed.\nAny additional textbooks will be indicated before the start of classes\n\nThe students that WILL ATTEND the lessons shall know the topic analyzed in class and articles and essays that will be indicated during the course and that will be available from the web page of the course (virtuale.unibo.it)\nMoreover, all students are advised to study the program reading also the following text: R.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course aims to provide students with a broad spectrum of knowledge on the use of virgin and recycled materials in the construction of roads, railways and airports. From the characterization of the different lithic resources obtained from quarries, up to the recycling processes of Construction and Demolition waste materials with particular reference to \"reclaimed asphalt\", the course deals with the most widespread standardized testing methods, along with the more scientifically advanced ones adopted for research purposes. Students will then refer the study of the materials’ use in pavement layers or in other parts of the construction in the form of bound or unbound mixtures, which in turn can be characterized on site or in the laboratory according to the existing specifications. On recycled materials, ample space is given to recycling processes and performance comparisons with natural and artificial virgin materials.\n\nThe construction and quality controls of the infrastructure represent a fundamental knowledge for those working in the field of transportation infrastructures: these topics will also be addressed with the help of case histories. Finally, the course will focus on the application of the most common models for the LCA/LCC study of materials and their consequent use in construction.\nCourse contents\nSECTION 1: Bearing capacity and Type of Infrastructures\nSECTION 2: Compaction – Densification– Testing density (Proctor) and bearing capacity (CBR)\nSECTION 3: Subgrade soil improvement: lime and lime/cement stabilization, soil replacement\nSECTION 4: Virgin Natural (quarried/excavated), artificial (LWA, etc), recycled (C&D, RAP, etc.) aggregates.\nSECTION 5: Laboratory testing methods for aggregates (standards methods, volumetrics, leaching, etc.)\nSECTION 6: Construction of Embankments and in situ testing \nSECTION 7: Capping and Foundation layers: functions and construction\nSECTION 8: Cement bound layers: mix-design methods\nSECTION 9: Asphalt concretes: basics\nSECTION 10: Case history of an experimental recycled road pavement and LCA of its materials.\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe subject is wide and there is no specific book or reading to entirely cover the course.\nA number of textbooks and papers will be mentioned during the lectures.\nTeaching methods\nLectures will be imparted in the classroom with slides and projected documents.\nAssessment methods\nAchievements will be assessed by the means of a final exam. This is based on an analytical assessment of the \"expected learning outcomes\" described above.\nIn order to properly assess such achievement the examination is composed of different sections and it is normally oral. When possible, the student will be allowed to write part of the answers and formulas to ease the assessment process. \nThe oral session, consists of a technical conversation on three different topics among the course ones.\nHigher grades will be awarded to students who demonstrate an organic understanding of the subject, a high ability for critical application, and a clear and concise presentation of the contents.\nTo obtain a passing grade, students are required to at least demonstrate a knowledge of the key concepts of the subject, some ability for critical application, and a comprehensible use of technical language.\nTeaching tools\nStudents can download the lecture notes from the Virtuale webpage.\nThese are colour slides with specific notes and comments.\nSlides are updated each year.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Cesare Sangiorgi"

The studente is expected to be able to: 1. contributr to design products and processes that are intrinsecally suitable for a smart recycling of the components and materials; 2. to propose alternatives to the critical raw materials now in great use, or improve their recycle; 3. to exploit the instuments of LCA for the assessment of improvements achievable.\nCourse contents\nThis CU is composed of three modules which are taught autonomously:\n(1) Life Cycle Assessment:\nLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an internationally standardized methodology to evaluate the eco-sustainability of processes and products over their life-cycle, supporting comparisons between alternatives and providing a rank of environmental priorities in the investigated systems. It is used as a quantitative basis for decision-making in industry, academia and policy contexts.\n\n(2) Sustainability and Circularity of Material Flows\nIn this module students learn to apply material flow analysis to important raw materials used in the chemical industry. These will be used to develop indicators for circularity and sustainability of chemical processes.\n(3) Design for Recycling\nIn design for recycling, the suitability of a product design for recycling is considered, with products designed for easy disassembly and the use of compatible raw materials. This module covers the concept, rules and guidelines of design for recycling.\nReadings/Bibliography\nLecture notes and selected papers will be available for students. \nRecommended reading:\n\nISO 14040 and ISO 14044\nBrunner, P.H.; Rechberger, H. “Practical Handbook of Material Flow Analysis”.

The student is able to handle the main tools of this theory that can be used to construct mathematical models.\nCourse contents\nThose students interested in the combinatorial aspects of the cours will be able to deepen such aspects in the course Group theory (09346), which will be activated next year and will cover the Coxeter groups. \nLie algebras are fascinating algebraic structures, with many applications in geometry and mathematical physics. In this course, we will study finite dimensional Lie algebras.\nAfter studying some basic classes of Lie algebras (such as the nilpotent and the solvable ones), we will focus on the class of semisimple Lie algebras. We will describe their structure, their classification and finally their representation theory.\nIn particular we will introduce the fundamental notion of root system, and we will study particular finite reflection groups associated to them, called Weyl groups. We will see how these objects of combinatorial nature allow to classify the semisimple Lie algebras and their irreducible representations.\nWeekly exercises will be assigned to guide the students in the learning process.\nThe only prerequisite of the course is a good knowledge of linear algebra.\nThose students intersted in representation theory in ther contexts - such as groups and associative algebras - are invited to follow the courses Complementi di Algebra (66696) and Combinatoria Algebrica (96730).\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe fundamental reference for this course is the book\n\nJ. Humphreys: Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory, third edition, Springer, 1990.\n\nAnother useful reference (a bit more approachable than the previous one, but not covering the representation theory) is\n\nK. Erdmann, M. Wildon: Introduction to Lie algebras, Springer, 2006.\n\nBoth books are available in ebook version from the catalogue of the departmental library through the student account.\n \n\n \nTeaching methods\nEvery week, 4 hours of frontal instruction and one extra hour dedicated to the exercises (to be decided together with the students).\nExercise sheets will be weekly assigned. Student's work on the exercises will be fundamental for the understanding of the theory.\nAssessment methods\nDelivery of the exercises assigned during the course and oral exam.\nTeaching tools\nFrontal teaching at the blackboard, and exercise sheets delivered weekly.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Jacopo Gandini\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Alessandro D'Andrea"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThis course will teach a number of soft skills required to be ready for the prepration of the Thesis and to communicate scientific content to a broad audience. In this course it will be though how to write a technical document, a scientific article and project proposals.\nCourse contents\nScientific project writing and communication is nowadays an almost daily activity, which is required at every level and grade of one's scientific career. Project writing has become part of the scientific daily working routine, while the effective and concise conveyance of scientific results, both in written and oral form, is essential to convey the results of one's work in a way that makes an impact in an environment of information overload. All this must be declined from a teamwork perspective: today's problems are complex; hence, solutions need to be achieved by combining knowledge and skills from different people.\n\n \nAim and structure\nThis course aims to develop scientific and technical writing skills, as well as public speaking ability, through an interactive and team-based approach. The above-mentioned topics are tackled into three different hands-on modules from which each student must choose at least two:\n- Technical Writing (mandatory): this module is devoted to developing writing skills specifically targeted for technical documents, scientific reports and project proposals. Strategies to structure the contents and organise the writing in a collaborative manner will be discussed and applied to the writing of a real project proposal, responding to a real call of the EU programme.\nResponsible: Dr Carlo Cintolesi - Researcher. Organisation: 6 meetings for 18 hours of lessons.\n- Science Communications (optional): in this module, a professional journalist specialised in science dissemination offers interactive meetings with practical activities on the following topics: historical and theoretical overview; communication models; scientific journalism; and how to present science in public.\nResponsible: Dr Marco Boscolo - Science Journalist. Organisation: 4 meetings for 16 hours of lessons.\n- Storytelling in Science (optional): participating in this module, the student will learn how to structure, prepare and realise a presentation on a scientific topic for the general public, using the tools offered by the theatre to generate a sense of curiosity and wonder. \nResponsible: Dr Andrea Brunello - Theater Artistic Director. Organisation: 4 meetings for 16 hours of lessons.\n \nGeneral Objectives\nAt the end of the course, the student will acquire soft professional skills working in disciplinary themes in physical sciences. Specifically, he/she will gain abilities in: (i) writing a scientific project; (ii) scientific communication and journalism; (iii) science outreach.\n \nHow to choose the module\nComplete the questionnaire “Choice of the Laboratory Activity” on virtuale.unibo.it making your selection between:\n\n “Storytelling in Science”  \n“Science communication”\n\n\n \nReadings/Bibliography\nTeaching material is provided during the course via a shared folder.\nTeaching methods\nLectures and interactive classroom activities. Individual or group work at home to produce the outcomes required by the selected modules.\nAssessment methods\nAttendance is required (no less than 75%)\n\nNo Final Exam: each laboratory activity aims at producing a specific outcome, that must be submitted and validated by the responsible of the module.\nTeaching tools\nPresentations, research articles, working material (tutorials, group working sheets, research questionnaires).\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Carlo Cintolesi\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Tobias Cramer\n                        \n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Marco Boscolo"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThis course mainly focuses on the application of free and open source algorithms - which ensure high reproducibility and robustness of ecological analysis - to study ecological change in space and time, due to both human impact and global change. Particular emphasis will be given to: 1) population ecology: how organisms spread in space and how to study it by point pattern analysis, 2) how community are structured and how to study such structure by multivariate analysis; 3) monitoring species distributions and their change in space and time by species distribution modelling; 4) monitoring ecosystem change in space and time by remote sensing data. The course is dramatically practical giving space to exercises and additional ecological issues provided by the professor and suggested by students. We will make use of R which is one of the main free and open source software for ecological modelling. Students will finally be able to create their own project on monitoring of spatial and temporal changes of species and ecosystems at different spatial scales.\n\nNo previous knowledge of R is necessary. we will start from scratch, giving us time to practice and learn, creating knowledge instead of just information.\nCourse contents\nLab plan:\n\n1.

Wiley, third edition.\nTeaching methods\nClass lectures\nTutorial sessions in computer lab or using personal laptops in classroom\nAs concerns the teaching methods of this course unit, all students must attend Module 1, 2 on Health and Safety online\nAssessment methods\nThe exam will test the qualifications of each student on both a theoretical and a practical level.\nThe exam is composed of two parts that have to be taken during the same exam sitting.\n\n\nThe first mandatory part consists in a (possibly computer-based) quiz containing a set of multiple-choice and open-answer questions about the models presented during the course. These questions focus both on theoretical properties and on R instructions or output produced using the software R. As far as the multiple-choice questions are concerned, correct answers are marked with 1 point, wrong answers are marked -0.20 points and missing answers 0 points. Each open-answer question receives a mark ranging between 0 and 2, depending on the correctness of the answer and the appropriateness of the terminology. The number of multiple-choice and open-answer questions may vary from sitting to sitting, holding fixed the maximum mark to 24. Students will have 60 minutes to complete this quiz. Consulting textbooks or personal notes during the written exam is not allowed.\nAs far as the first sitting is concerned, students have the option of splitting the mandatory quiz exam into two partial exams, each lasting 30 minutes and with a maximum mark fixed at 12. The first partial quiz takes place after the first 5 weeks and is focused on the topics covered during the first part of the course. The second partial quiz is scheluled after the end of the course, and covers the topics addressed during the second part of the course. Students must take both partial quiz exams. In particular, in order to register for the second partial quiz, a student must have taken the first partial quiz. Furthermore, students taking the first partial quiz are not allowed to take the total quiz exam during the first sitting after the end of the course.\n\n\nThe second mandatory part is a computer-based practical exam. The practical exam assesses the ability of a student in uisng R to solve a practical problem. Students will be asked to write an R script and to report results obtained using that script. Students will reveive a mark ranging between 0 and 7, depending on the correctness of the answer and the appropriateness and correctness of the corresponding R script. Students will have 30 minutes to complete this second mandatory part. Consulting textbooks or personal notes during the practical exam is allowed.\nThe final mark is given by the sum of the marks obtained in the practical and in the written exam. Non-integer final marks are rounded down to the next small integer. Final marks larger that 30 are rounded down to 30. Final marks equal to 31 are considered 30 cum laude.\nIn case of failure or rejection of the overall mark, students must repeat the whole exam in one of the following sittings. In particular, students are allowed to reject a positive mark and retake the exam at least once but no more than twice.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Giuliano Galimberti"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe student will learn the main climate features of the tropical system  with an emphasis on coupled atmosphere-ocean processes in the equatorial Indo-Pacific region. Theough this course the student will address the dynamics of tropical coupled processes, from the Madden-Julian Oscillation, to El Nino/Southern Oscillation, the Asian Summer Monsoon and their interaction with the overall global variability, using idealized and more complete models. At the end of the course the student will be able to assess how these phenomena can be modelled and predicted using Earth system models using deterministic and statistical methods.\nCourse contents\nThe tropics cover about 40% of the world surface and play a dominant role in the Earth’s climate system by influencing global atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns and shaping weather systems. In this course we will introduce the fundamental processes characterizing tropical climate and dynamics on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales: from local (~km) to planetary (~10^4km) and from daily to multi-decadal. \nIn the first part of the course, we will begin with defining the tropics and reviewing the fundamental physical processes involved in the air-sea interaction, and therefore responsible for the exchange of heat, water, and momentum between the ocean and atmosphere. By looking at observational products, we will show that compared to the extratropics, the coupling between the ocean and atmosphere is generally stronger in the tropics, where atmospheric convection and wind stress are largely controlled by tropical SSTs.\nIn the second part, we will explore wave dynamics and discuss how at low-latitude waves play a crucial role in shaping tropical variability from sub-seasonal to interannual timescales. We will derive shallow water equations and then use their linearized set to derive and discuss inertia-gravity, Rossby and Kelvin waves. The dispersion relation of equatorial shallow water waves on the beta plane (Matsuno spectrum) will be also derived and discussed.\nLastly, we will explore dominant modes of ocean-atmosphere coupling in the tropics. Specifically, we will focus on intraseasonal oscillations (also known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation, MJO), the Indian Ocean Dipole mode, and the phenomenon of El Niño, which is a manifestation of Earth’s strongest climate mode on interannual timescales, namely El Niño-Southern Oscillation mode (ENSO). Several lectures will be devoted to ENSO: after exploring El Niño dynamics and theory, which is based on equatorial wave dynamics, we will discuss ENSO teleconnections and interaction with other climate modes, as well as its impacts, monitoring, and prediction methods. This part will end with a brief overview of Tropical cyclones dynamics: formation mechanisms, structure, tracking, forecasting techniques, and impacts.\nThis course will be characterized by a strong hands-on component of data analysis and modeling that will be developed in Python through a combination of in-class practical sessions and homework. State-of-the-art observational datasets will be used to analyze climate processes and modes, and to set up, calibrate and test low-order models of ENSO (e.g., ENSO delayed oscillator and recharge oscillator) and other tropical modes. \nReadings/Bibliography\nEssential of Atmospheric and Oceanic Dynamics (Geoffrey K.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nVolcanism is one of the most dramatic and rapid agent of geologic change. Even though less frequent and devastating than earthquakes, any kind of volcano can produce hazardous or deadly phenomena, whether during an eruption or in quiescence conditions, thus inducing risks for densely populated areas around the world. Some eruptions can have a meaningful global impact on Earth’s climate, either with cooling or warming effects, through the ejection of large amounts of ash particles and gases into the atmosphere. Understanding the eruptive behaviour of a volcano is the first step in mitigating volcanic hazards (and risk), eventually taking into consideration some elements of unpredictability inherent to these natural systems. At the end of the course, students will acquire knowledge on the main eruptive processes (lava flows, explosive eruptions, volcano-tectonic collapses, lahars) and their effects on persons, properties and resources and the environment, with a particular focus on the eruptive phenomena that can potentially affect (global) climate changes (ash dispersal, gas emission). Moreover, students will learn about the main parameters for the monitoring of volcanoes, i.e. deformation of the soil, seismicity, and fluid geochemistry, particularly implementing the monitoring techniques based on gas emission in volcanic-hyrothermal systems by means of laboratory experiments on analytical methods. Laboratory activities will also concern the most important models used for volcanic hazards and risk assessment and the mathematical and statistical methods for processing data in terms of volcanic plume dynamics and atmospheric transport of volcanic ash, gravity-driven phenomena (lava flows, pyroclastic currents and lahars) and dispersal of volcanic and hydrothermal gases into the air. The course will be integrated by a field excursion in Italian active volcanic areas (Etna, Stromboli, Vulcano, Vesuvius and Campi Flegrei), including visits to volcanic observatories and seminars of researchers from other institutions about their monitoring.\nCourse contents\nThe course is arranged into different sections aimed at providing a general framework of knowledge on eruptive activity starting from its magmatic sources to the volcanic edifices on surface, and at defining the main eruption types and depositional mechanisms of the various eruptive processes with a special outcome on the evaluation of the different volcanic hazards and risks. I – Physical properties of magmas. Magma chambers, dykes and eruptive conduits. II – Explosive volcanism. Classification of volcanic activity and eruption types. Magmatic fragmentation. Eruptive plumes and fall deposits. Pyroclastic density currents and their deposits. III - Effusive volcanism. Features and flow dynamics of mafic lava flows (pahoehoe and aa). Features and flow dynamics of silicic lavas: blocky lava flows, rhyolitic lava flows (coulees), lava domes. IV - Volcano-tectonic collapses (calderas and sector collapses). Post-eruption mass gravity flows (debris avalanches, lahar). V - Eruption forecast. Volcanic hazard maps. Volcano monitoring. Risk mitigation in volcanic areas. The course will take into account the most famous eruptions in the history of volcanology and recent examples as study cases of hazard evaluation and risk mitigation. A part of the course will be dedicated to a flipped-learning exercise during which the teachers will propose case studies that the students, in small groups, will have to analyze and study, identifying specific aspects and possible interpretations, then presenting to the rest of the class what achieved, discussing the main aspects together with the other students and teachers. A field excursion in Italian active volcanic areas (Etna, Stromboli, Vulcano, Vesuvius and Campi Flegrei) will complete the course, including also visits to volcanic observatories and monitoring centres.\nTeacher in charge: Prof. Federico Lucchi\nCollaborator teacher: Dott.Matteo Roverato\n\nThe course is organized into 32 hours of frontal lessons (4 CFU), and 12 hours of field activity (2 CFU)\nReadings/Bibliography\nPower Point lecture notes.\n• H.U.
