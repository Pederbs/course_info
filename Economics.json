        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThis course studies the economics of competition and antitrust, with a special focus on financial and banking markets. Students learn how to define the relevant markets; how to measure the market power of agents and the degree of market concentration. They are then introduced to the major antitrust violations and the typical measures taken to stop competition-harming behavior (from price fixing to abuse of dominance). They consider antitrust implications of network interconnectedness in different segments of financial markets (included payment systems). The economic analysis of merger regulation is also examined. At the end of the course, the student knows how to apply the most important economic models to antitrust cases, and knows how to use rigorous models in the analysis of competition policy issues.\nCourse contents\n1.

The exam consists of 2 open-ended questions (up to 4 points each) and 6 multiple-choice questions (for which students are required to justify their answer based on the theory learnt - up to 2 points each).\nThe scoring for the open-ended questions is based on the correctness, thoroughness, and completeness of the response. The student must demonstrate an understanding of the topic, be able to present it rigorously, critically examine the main aspects, and account for the scientific and political debate.\nThe scoring for the multiple-choice questions is as follows: each correct answer is worth 2 points if justified. Correct answers without justification are worth 0 points. Incorrect answers are worth 0 points. The justification should provide a brief explanation of why the student believes the chosen answer is correct.\nThe maximum total score obtainable in the final written exam is 20 points, which is converted to a thirty-point scale as follows: 20 points correspond to 32. Lower scores are converted proportionally.\n \nTeaching tools\n- Slides and other material will be available on the course website.\n- During the first three weeks a tutor will offer 1-2 review sessions on the economic tools that the Professor will use in the remainder of the course.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Matteo Alvisi"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course introduces the student to the sociological-empirical analysis of societal phenomena, such as integration, acceleration, polarization, fragmentation and social action, such as conflict, protest, critique, social mobilization, and claims-making. The course introduces the students to a range of methodological approaches to the study of society/social actors in interaction with politics, law, and the economy. The course enhances the student's capacity and skills to analyze society, social actors, and social problems by using sociological and interdisciplinary instruments.\nCourse contents\nIn the first part, the course provides an introduction to political sociology, its main sociological theories, concepts, and forms of analysis. Political sociology will be explored through main themes including power and authority, conflict in society, forms of mobilization, societal actors and civil society, and interaction with state (and international/transnational) institutions as well as economic actors.\nIn the second part, the course will provide a specific (and critical) attention to forms of (innovative) data gathering, measurement, ranking, the usage of big data, and the potential downsides to the collection and uses of big data. The course will critically discuss formatting, codification, quantification, measurement, rankings, forms of surveillance and control, performance indicators and auditing.\nIn the third part, we will explore specific case-studies around four themes: Rule of law and democracy; Human rights, crime, surveillance, and justice; Market economy, the digital world.\n \n1. Introduction to Political Sociology (14 hrs)\nThe introduction of sociology and political sociology will discuss the sociologial approach to studying political and related (e.g. legal) phenomena. A core intention is to problematize concepts and phenomena we tend to take for granted, including in relatio to the following key theories and concepts:\npower, authority,\npolitical culture, legitimacy,\nthe state,\ncitizenship,\nsocietal integration and unity,\nconflict and polariztaion in society,\nsocietal acceleration,\nsocietal mobilization, actors, civil society, social movements, protest\n \n2. Political sociology, datafication, and data analysis (10 hrs)\nMuch of sociology, including political sociology, attempts to empirically (and critically) analyze social and political phenomena (such as those discussed in the first part) and engages with data-gathering as well as data analysis, forms of categorization, measurement and ranking of data. Data elaboration is frequently understood as a methodological matter, but may be equally critically observed as a distinctive set of practices that may significantly shape the capacities of political sociology to make claims and come up with meaningful research results.\n \n3. Observing sociological analysis in distinct case-studies (16 hrs)\na. Rule of law and democracy (6 hrs)\nThe rule of law is often considered in crisis, due to the rise of populist and authoritarian political forces, but also as a result of malgovernance (and the application of AI) more generally. A core way of addressing this crisis is to by means of monitoring the rule of law (on the basis of multi-dimensional indicators and measurements, such as in the Rule of Law index of the World Justice project). Quantitative technologies of measurement are evermore frequently used, but face a number of distinct problems, such as in-built bias, definitional problems, simplification, and reification.\n \nb. Human rights, crime, surveillance, and justice (6 hrs)\nIn the areas of international human rights and justice, evermore frequently digital technologies, AI, big data and open source investigation are being used to fight crime and injustice. Open source information opens possibilities of public participation in data gathering and analysis, and investigative journalism, but it also raises important questions for empirical sociology in terms of challenges to existing methods. The usage of digital means and bulk surveillance further create significant tensions with basic human rights, such as those to privacy, freedom of speech, and non-discrimination.\n \nc. Market economy, the digital world (4 hrs)\nBig data raises questions of who controls, owns, and has access to data infrastructures. A predominance of market actors, and specific countries such as the US and China, in controlling data and data systems may significantly forms of inequality, discrimination, and exclusion, while public monitoring and control might be largely absent. One example is the field of health, where on one hand the quality of care may be increasing and costs reduced, on the other social inquealities and access to health care may be declining.\nReadings/Bibliography\nOuthwaite, W. and S.P.

The problem is to be subsequently related to key concepts, which are to be operationalized so they can be further studied, analyzed, and/or measured. Finally, the student needs to indicate which method(-s) are best used to study the problem.\nThe student can choose from two formats:\n\nA written essay or blog of minimally 1500 words;\nA podcast of at least 5 minutes of discussion.\n\n\n \nFinal exam\nThe final exam consists in a written essay of minimally 3.000 words and a relevant and utilized bibliography of minimally 10 academic sources (5 need to come from the syllabus/the Virtuale platform). The written essay needs to develop a small research project in political sociology, based on a research question and the identification of key concepts, and turning those key concepts into operationalized dimensions, which will then be applied in empirical research. \n The essay needs to be submitted not later than 1 week before the exam date. The paper will be evaluated on the basis of 5 criteria (introduction, main argument/design, conclusions, references, and written language).\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Paulus Albertus Blokker"

In particular, the student understands the empirical methodologies adopted, the theoretical implications of the findings, and their possible applications in economic environment with and without strategic interaction.\nCourse contents\nThe core theory used in economics rests on basic assumptions on individual selfishness, rationality and utility maximization. During the last three decades, these assumptions have been put into question by a growing stream of literature, broadly defined as “behavioral economics,” which aims at improving the descriptive accuracy of these assumptions, while maintaining the formal discipline of economic modeling. Based on field and experimental evidence on how individual behavior departs from the conventional theoretical predictions, behavioral economists have posited explanations for these departures, proposed extensions to the existing models and alternative theoretical approaches aimed at capturing them, and considered what are the possible practical implications of these findings.\nThis course aims at providing a critical overview of the most active and influential areas of research in this field, with a focus on the empirical methodologies adopted, on the theoretical implications of the findings, and on their possible applications (e.g., in the fields of health and labor economics, finance, marketing). It is divided into two main sections, the first dealing with individual choices, the second with strategic interaction. In the first part of the course we will discuss topics related to preferences over risky and uncertain outcomes, intertemporal choices, reference dependence and loss-aversion. In the second part of the course, we will deal with the literature concerning behavioral game theory, which uses the tools of standard game theory, but takes into consideration emotions, mistakes, limited foresight, and doubts about how smart others are.\nPrerequisite knowledge:\nMicroeconomics - Master level [https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2022/350066] and Game Theory [https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2022/350067]\n \nTopics\nPart 1\n\nAnomalies in decision-making\nDecision-making under risk\nReference dependence, loss aversion and endowment effect\nIntertemporal preferences\n\nPart 2\n\nbehavioral game theory\nsocial preferences\nmotivated beliefs\n\nPart 3\n\ncriticisms to behavioral economics\nconclusions\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nDhami, Sanjit. \"The Foundations of Behavioral Economic Analysis.\" Oxford University Press, 2016.\nDellaVigna, Stefano. \"Psychology and Economics: Evidence from the Field.\" Journal of Economic Literature 47.2 (2009): 315-372.\nCamerer, Colin F., George Loewenstein, and Matthew Rabin, eds.

Princeton University Press, 2003.\nTeaching methods\nEach class will be devoted to the discussion of one core issue in behavioral economics. Before or during the classes, students will be invited to participate in a short on-line mock experiment, replicating the basic features of the studies that will be later presented. Results will be later analyzed and compared to those prevailing in the literature. The second part of the class will be dedicated to the theoretical models developed to account for the empirical findings, and the last part will deal with their policy implications and possible practical applications.\nAssessment methods\nStudents will be assessed based on four weakly problem-sets, and a final in-class exam.\nThe final examination aims at evaluating the achievement of the following goals:\n- knowledge of the most influential models of behavioral economics, in the realms of decision making under uncertainty, intertemporal decision making, behavioral game theory, and social preferences.\n- understanding of the empirical methodologies adopted in the articles surveyed during the course\n- understanding of the theoretical implications of the empirical findings, and their possible practical implications.\nThe problem sets will be published on the course' e-learning platform.\nIn the problem-sets (accounting for 5% of the mark each) students will have to comment or interpret graphs, figures and equations from the studies discussed in class, or briefly summarize the results. For the problem-sets teamwork is allowed but in the end each student will have to hand in his own answer, and “carbon-copied” works will be strongly penalized.\nThe final exam (80% of the mark) will last 2 hours, and will include a set of 6 questions of increasing complexity, covering both the mathematical/analytical aspects of the models discussed in class and their interpretation.\nThe maximum possible score is 30 cum laude, in case all answers are correct, complete and formally rigorous.\nThe grade is graduated as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\nThe exam will be held in the computer lab. Questions will be randomly extracted from a predefined set, so the exam content will be different for each student. In case online exams will be envisaged by the University of Bologna, the structure of the written exam is the same. The exam will be run through Zoom and Exams Online (EOL). Detailed instructions on how to manage and hand in the online exam are available on the course page on the VIRTUALE platform.\nIn the final exam students may use calculators (but not other electronic devices), but they may not communicate with others, consult notes, books, or other written material. Any attempt to violate these rules will result in the student's exclusion from the exam.\nAt the end of the course, students have the opportunity to choose one paper at the frontier of the literature and briefly discuss it in a short presentation. The presentation is optional, and can lead to a marginal increase (or decrease) of the final grade.\nTeaching tools\nDuring the course, students will be involved in mock experiments, which should provide them with a more vivid idea of the issues to be examined later during the lecture, and active participation to the in-class discussion will be encouraged.\nParticipation in the mock experiments and the completion of the four problem sets is required. Attending classes is instead not compulsory, even though it is recommended.\nThe mock experiments will be computer-based and will require the use of a pc, tablet or smartphone connected to the internet.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Maria Bigoni"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the class, the student has acquired knowledge of how behavioral economics is used to design more effective public policy in areas of taxation, education and labor markets. In particular, the student understands the neoclassical approach to public economics, the shortcomings of the neoclassical model in public economics and how behavioral economics may be applied. The student will understand the theoretical implications of behavioral welfare analysis, analyze and engage in public policy design.\nCourse contents\nThe standard neoclassical theory used in Public Economics and Public Policy rests on basic assumptions on individual selfishness, rationality and utility maximization. However, research at the intersection of Psychology and Economics (i.e., Behavioral Economics) challenges many of these underlying assumptions and aims to develop more descriptive models of individual and market behavior.\nThis course aims to study classic topics in Public Economics and Policy, including taxation, education and policy instruments but accounting for the shortcomings of the standard neoclassical model and supplementing the neoclassical treatment of these topics with insights from behavioral economics.\nWe will begin each topic of the course with an introduction to the neoclassical treatment of the topic. We will then explore the implications of the neoclassical model and ask what identify potential limitations of the assumptions of the standard model. For example, consider the question of whether taxing cigarettes can lead to higher welfare. The standard model posits that individuals make utility maximizing choices and thus the choice to smoke is optimal and imposing taxes leads to a deadweight loss. However, what if individuals are not utility maximizing and instead make errors in deciding whether or how much to smoke? If so, imposing a tax on cigarette consumption may serve to “correct” this error in decision-making and thereby improve consumer welfare. We will then identify a current public policy related to the topic and discuss how we might analyze its effectiveness.\nWe will cover both theoretical foundations in behavioral public economics and the design and testing of public policies.\nThe course will also highlight the link between theory and practice. We will do this with one or two guest lectures from individuals who span this divide between academia and \"real world\" policy design.\nA solid foundation in microeconomics and applied mircoeconometrics is a pre-requisite for attending the course.\nTopics include\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Behavioral Public Economics.\nTheory of Welfare.\nTheory of Policy interventions: Taxation & Nudges.\nHealth issues and policies.\nEnvironmental issues and policies.\nSavings & Retirement.\nEducation & Labor Market (e.g., minimum wage policies, discrimination)\n\nExperimental design, RCTs and Policy Evaluation.\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nAll readings will be made available to students. There will be no need to purchase a textbook. Readings listed in alphabetical order.\nBernheim, B. D., & Taubinsky, D. (2018). Behavioral public economics.

Yale University Press.\nTeaching methods\nEach week will be devoted to the discussion of one core issue in behavioral public economics and public policy. We will discuss the theoretical background of each topic which will then be followed by studying and discussing the seminal papers on the topic.\nEach class will have a lecture and discussion component.\nIn this class, teaching participates in the University's didactic innovation project by allocating up to 6 hours of online learning that will allow us to invite up to 2 guest speakers. This online component allows us to invite speakers from outside Bologna to provide practical insights at the intersection of behavioral economics and public policy.\nAssessment methods\nThere is one final assessment for this class which is in the form of a final oral presentation/discussion of a paper during the final week of the course. Students will have several examples throughout the course of the type of presentation that is expected and will be given ample time to ask questions and work on their presentation. The aim of the presentation is to assess (1) students understanding of the course material and how it relates to the paper; and 2) students ability to synthesize and discuss the complex ideas and concepts.\nThe grade is graduated as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\nTeaching tools\nDedicated page on the VIRTUALE platform containing:\n\nNews and updated information.\nLectures slides.\nReferences to relevant articles published on scientific journals.\n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Stephanie Heger"

The group works are carried out by groups of students (composed of a maximum of 3 or 4 subjects) who are formed independently and who carry out a real psychographic CRM project. The guidelines for the technical implementation of the group project are described during the course and in any case it involves applying the data analysis strategies addressed in the course to opinion data, collected by the group through an electronic questionnaire: definition of the topic, editing of the questionnaire, treatment of the distortion effects generated by the opinion scale, statistical modeling using the SAS software, drafting of the report to be delivered to the teacher.\nAssessment methods\nThe exam is an individual oral discussion of a group work. The rating scale ranges from 1 to 30 and is a continuous indicator. The oral exam consists of 3/4 questions. The starting hypothesis is that the student knows the entire exam program perfectly and that, depending on the quality of his answers, starting from 30 (maximum grade) this grade can be reduced.

It will cover matching and difference-in-differences strategies, and quasi-experimental approaches to identification. \nAt the end of the class, student will be able:\n-\tto critically understand the application of these tools in the recent empirical economic literature;\n-\tto apply these approaches to design his/her own  program evaluation.\nCourse contents\nThe class is available only in English.\nThe course covers empirical strategies for applied (mainly micro-economics) research questions. The main goal of the course is to provide an overview of the statistical tools for counterfactual analysis and a deeper discussion of a selection of these tools (recent advances in difference-in-differences; synthetic control methods; IV-LATE and regression discontinuity design), from the theoretical and empirical point of view.\nThe course illustrates the identification strategies, estimation and other related issues (eg internal and external validity) that are relevant for the assessment of causal effects (or equivalently treatment effects) using observational data.\nWe will discuss Randomized Trials because they represent the benchmark of non-experimental methods. Experimental methods are illustrated and discussed in detail in other courses at graduate and undergraduate level.\nFixed effects and random effects model are covered in other courses offered within the program and will not be discussed in detail. We will touch on fixed effects models, because they are related to the Difference-in-Differences approach to identification and this is a pre-requisite to discuss Synthetic Control approach. The emphasis of the course will be on Synthetic control and recent advances in the literature on Difference-in-Differences, moving from a review of the standard 2 period,2 groups Difference-in-Differences set-up.\nWe touch on Instrumental Variable Strategies as they are pre-requisite to discuss Fuzzy-Regression Discontinuity. Compared to standard econometrics courses, we will discuss advanced issues related to IV (LATE interpretation and external validity).\nFeatures of each particular econometric tool will be illustrated from both the theoretical and practical point of view, often through the discussion of empirical applications.\nThe emphasis will be on the practical implementation of each approach.\nTopics\n\nFundamentals of Impact Evaluation (approximately 6 hours, including practice sessions; week 1 classes)\n\nThe Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference\nPotential Outcomes Framework\nBasic Approaches to Identification:Randomized Trials\nBasic Approaches to Identification:Selection on Observables (Propensity Score Matching)\n\n\n\nQuasi-Experiments: IV (approximately 6 hours; week 2 classes)\n\nInstrumental Variables: Identification, Estimation, Falsification Checks (Placebo), Interpretation (LATE), External Validity; Weak Instruments\n\n\n\nStrategies exploting the structure of the data (approximately 12 hours, including practice sessions; week 3 and week 4 classes) \n\n\n\nDifference-in-Differences and recent advances on two-way fixed effects and difference-in-differences with heterogeneous treatment effects\nNon-linear difference-in-differences\nSynthetic Control Methods \n\n\n\nQuasi-Experiments: Jumps (approximately 6 hours, week 5 classes)\n\nRegression Discontinuity Design: Sharp and Fuzzy Designs, Identification, Estimation, Falsification Checks\nMultiple cutoffs, Multiple Running Variables (eg Geographic RDD): insights\n\nExternal Validity: Extrapolating Away from the Cutoff\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nIl corso è offerto solo in lingua inglese.\nLectures will be based on the following books and articles.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the Teaching Activities related to the course Commercial Law, students will count with a comprehensive understanding of the main institutions accountable for the corporations and the firms, focusing on their basic characteristics and tasks, from the moment certain commercial regulations are conceived until these same regulations and norms expire. Furthermore, students will be able to acquire and grasp the basic notions about all the different types of firms, consortiums and lobbies, in order to assess and verify how these organizations, which are widespread in the Italian Economic scenario, could be profitably used for the practice of the economic activity (principles, structures and organizations). The International approach to the course Commercial Law sets the platform for a continuous comparative evaluation between Italian commercial law and Italian Industrial legislation versus the international directives on this very field (with a special focus on EU regulation on the subject), also considering international agreements, basic concepts of commercial law and industrial law, taking into careful consideration the antitrust legislation, unfair competition and unfair practices like dumping, misleading communication, the regulation of particularities and all creative activities, regulation of know-how and of technologies as well.\nCourse contents\n\nIntroduction to Commercial Law\nHistory of Corporate Law\nSeparate Legal Personality\nLimited Liability\nShares and Shareholder Rights\nThe General Meeting\nThe Board of Directors\nDirectors' Duties\nLegal Capital\nEU competition law policy and economics\nArticle 101(1)\nArticle 101(3)\nArticle 102\nMergers\nIntroduction to intellectual property law\nPatent law\nCopyright law\nTrademark law\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nExam materials will be provided on virtuale.\nTeaching methods\nEach lecture will focus on a specific topic.

It focuses on approaches that conceptualise different models of capitalism and investigates the role of political actors, institutions and interest groups in shaping and transforming these models.\nThe course is structured around two key questions: To what extent do differences in institutional settings shape fundamentally different models of democratic capitalism? What is the role of political parties, institutions, firms and labour unions in determining the different arrangements we find in capitalist countries?\n\nThis course participates to the Teaching Experimentation Project of Bologna University. The maximum number of students attending the course is 50.\n\n\nThe course tackles the following United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGS): 1, 4, 5,8,9,10.\n\nLearning outcomes\n \nAt the end of the course students will be able to:\n\nAnalyse and compare national political economies\nCritically evaluate political economic inputs and outcomes\nUnderstand the institutional foundations of comparative advantage\nDesign a research project using the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) datasets available on the LIS website \nWrite a short paper on a topic agreed with the professor discussing the LIS results.\n\nCourse procedure\nThe course is organized in lectures and inverted classes, as detailed in the following program. Lectures (24 hours) aim to introduce students to the core tenets of the discipline. Inverted classes aim to provide occasions for in-depth discussions of class materials and exercises, as well as group presentations For the inverted classes, students will be divided into groups according to their preferences: two group(s) will do the inverted class in classroom (18 hours per group) Therefore, a total of 42 classroom hours are scheduled for each student. Students are required to carefully read the assigned material before the session and - in the case of inverted class - active participation through group presentations of existing scholarship, project preparation and case studies will also be expected. \n \n \nCourse evaluation\nStudents are encouraged to actively participate during the class and to hand in one question per group per week to stimulate discussions. During the inverted class, students are required to prepare short group presentations.\n \nEvaluation \nParticipation in class will count for 10% of the grade.\nPresentation will count for 25% of the grade.\nThe final assessment is a written paper using the Luxembourg Income Study datasets, the LIS graphic software DART, and will count for 65% of the grade (3000 words in total including abstract, bibliography, tables and graphs. Each table counts 250 words; each graph counts 250 words.

It focuses on approaches that conceptualise different models of capitalism and investigates the role of political actors, institutions and interest groups in shaping and transforming these models.\nThe course is structured around two key questions: To what extent do differences in institutional settings shape fundamentally different models of democratic capitalism? What is the role of political parties, institutions, firms and labour unions in determining the different arrangements we find in capitalist countries?\n\nThis course participates to the Teaching Experimentation Project of Bologna University.

Lectures (24 hours) aim to introduce students to the core tenets of the discipline. Inverted classes aim to provide occasions for in-depth discussions of class materials and exercises, as well as group presentations For the inverted classes, students will be divided into groups according to their preferences: two group(s) will do the inverted class in classroom (18 hours per group) Therefore, a total of 42 classroom hours are scheduled for each student. Students are required to carefully read the assigned material before the session and - in the case of inverted class - active participation through group presentations of existing scholarship, project preparation and case studies will also be expected. \n \n \nCourse evaluation\nStudents are encouraged to actively participate during the class and to hand in one question per group per week to stimulate discussions.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThis course provides students with insights and tools for understanding and analyzing competition in today’s rapidly changing business landscapes. Active participation in the course's training activities, including lectures, seminars featuring business representatives, and group works, coupled with individual study, will empower students to:\n- Apply critical indicators to benchmark the firm's strategic positioning with respect to competitors.\n- Acquire knowledge to identify challenges and opportunities in rapidly changing technological, demand, and regulatory environments.\n- Acquire the necessary skills to understand the dynamics of competition in industries where digital platforms and connected ecosystems have redefined the rules of strategy.\nCourse contents\nCompetitive Analysis in Dynamic Environments is a comprehensive course designed to equip students with the strategic insights and analytical tools necessary to identify and understand competitors in today’s rapidly evolving and highly competitive business landscapes. Emphasizing the volatility and rapid changes in technology, consumer demand, and institutional frameworks, the course prepares students to detect a firm’s competitors in uncertain and rapidly changing environments. \nKey topics include:\n\nThe industry and its evolution over time\nThe relevant product and geographic market, as defined by competition authorities\nStrategic group analysis\nThe job-to-be-done theory\nBlue ocean strategy\nWindows of opportunity and changes in market leadership\nFirst-mover advantages in rapidly changing demand and technological environments\nMultimarket competition\nCompetition in platform-based industries\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nFor the preparation of the course, students are expected to study the following materials:\n- Readings in the form of academic articles, which will be downloadable from the Virtuale online platform.\n- Slides prepared by the instructor, uploaded at the end of each week on the Virtuale online platform.\nTeaching methods\n- Lectures focused on topics related to competitive analysis.\n- Discussion of case studies.\n- Seminars featuring business representatives.\nAssessment methods\nTo successfully complete the course, students are required to pass a written exam consisting of a combination of open-ended and multiple-choice questions. The exam format includes approximately five multiple-choice questions, each worth two points, and two open questions or exercises, each valued at 11 points. The duration of the test is one hour.\nIn addition to the written exam, students have the option to enhance their final grade by participating in group projects. These projects involve doing a competitor analysis of a firm using the tools discussed in class and presenting the findings in a PowerPoint presentation. Working in teams of 3-5 members, students are to submit their presentations to the instructor before the end of the course, with deadlines to be communicated in class. While this activity is not mandatory, it is highly recommended and can contribute a maximum of 4 extra points to the final grade. The project work will be presented by each team in front of the class at the conclusion of the course.\nThe final grading, following a scale of 0-30, adheres to the criteria outlined below:\n<18: Insufficient\n18-23: Sufficient\n24-27: Good\n28-30: Very good\n30 e lode (>30): Excellent\nIt is important to note that the final written exam is the same for both attending and non-attending students. \nTeaching tools\n\nCase studies\nArticles from business magazines\nLecture slides\nVideo\n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Claudio Giachetti"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThis course aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the psychological, social, and cultural factors that influence consumers' decision-making processes. \nOverall, the objectives of the course are to equip students with the knowledge, skills, and analytical tools necessary to understand and influence consumer behavior in the marketplace effectively.\nCourse contents\nThis course provides an overview of the most relevant and updated research in consumer behavior. The course is structured in order to provide students with a mixture of theory and practical applications by following logically and chronologically the steps that consumers encounter in their decision-making processes, that is to say Need Recognition, Search, Evaluation of the Alternatives, Choice, Post-Choice Evaluations. It has four main goals:\n- To focus on the fundamental theoretical perspectives that allow to understand and measure how consumers make decisions;\n- To provide students with the necessary tools to measure and analyze the different phases of the consumer’s decision making process;\n- To stimulate the translation of the theoretical concepts into the managerial practice;\n- To encourage students to work in a team, and to present and discuss their ideas and results with the audience.\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe course material consists of a collection of book chapters and scientific journal articles taken from different sources.\nThis “reading packet” is made available to students at Copisteria Asterisco (via Belle Arti, 31/B; just close to Bigiavi Library and round the corner from Piazza Scaravilli) to ensure that the photocopies comply with the current regulation in terms of copyrights. In order to purchase it, you just need to stop by at Copisteria Asterisco and ask for the Reading Packet for the course of Consumer Behavior by professors Chiara Orsingher and Gabriele Pizzi. We are aware that this might be a little bit more expensive than normal photocopies, but the material provided is protected by copyright and we are committed to the complete legality of the distribution of the course material. Nonetheless, we have done our best to make the total cost of the reading packet absolutely comparable to, if not lower than, the most widespread university textbook available in bookshops.\nLecture notes\nAttending class, taking notes, and asking questions is the best way to learn. In class we will provide lots of examples that will be portrayed in the lecture notes. Furthermore, the course material is very detailed. For these reasons, the lecture notes that we are providing are not to be intended as a summary of the textbook and are not exhaustive for a sufficient preparation to the exam. Rather, the notes serve as an outline for the instructors for developing the concepts in each lecture. Lecture notes will be made available to students before each class on the IOL platform in .pdf format, so that students can bring a printed version of the slides to annotate them during class at their convenience.\n            \n\n            \n                Teaching methods\nInteractive lessons, Group Works, Exercises and Managerial Talks\nAssessment methods\nThough not compulsory, class attendance and participation in team-work assignments is strongly encouraged. Team-work assignments consist of:\na) One intermediate short team-work project at the end of the first term: students will be asked to collect and analyze data on consumers’ consumption goals, and to write a short report (max 15 Power Point slides). Groups will be randomly extracted to present and discuss their reports in class on the assignment due date.\nb) One final team-work project at the end of the second term: students will be asked to work in group on a project aimed at understanding and analyzing how consumers form their attitudes and intentions toward a given purchase situation and to present in class the results and the managerial consequences of their projects (max 15 Power Point slides).\nCourse evaluation will be different depending on the participation in team-work assignment, as detailed in the following:\nStudents participating in team-work assignments:\n70% final written exam\n30% team-work assignment\nStudents who do not participate in team-work assignments:\n\n100% final written exam\nFinal written exam\nStudents can attend a mid-term exam (not compulsory) during the teaching break at the end of the first sub-cycle, and then the second mid-term exam at the end of the course. The grades of the two mid-term exams will be averaged to compute the “final written exam” grade.\nBy School regulation, those who positively pass the first mid-term exam (i.e. grade greater or equal to 18), have the chance to take the second mid-term exam either in the January or February session. However, the second mid-term can be taken only once. Therefore, if a student does not pass the second mid-term exam (or opts for a re-take), s/he can attend only total exams from that moment on.\nThe course material chapters on the topics discussed in the team-work assignments will be excluded from the exam program for those students who will participate in team-work assignments.\nThe overall grade is the arithmetic average of the results of the two checks.\n\nThe test assessment grid will be as follows:\n· <18 insufficient\n· 18-23 sufficient\n· 24-27 average/good\n· 28-30 very good\n· 30 cum laude excellent/outstanding\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Chiara Orsingher\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Gabriele Pizzi"

This includes the ability to understand the firm’s governance, and to assess the impact of investing, financing, and risk management decisions on the firm’s market value, in a classical shareholder’s wealth maximization framework.\nCourse contents\nCorporate Finance (48144) will provide students with an overview of financial decision-making within a firm. The course focuses on decisions concerning how firms should raise funds in different forms, and how they should invest in real assets. The first part of the course will deal with investment decisions, that is how to value investment projects and firms, while the second part will consider how to finance these investments. The final part of the course will examine how investment and financing decisions are related.

The midterm (final) will be based on the first (last) 10 class sessions. Both tests (i.e., midterm and final) will be in the form of a closed-book exam. The final grade of the course will be the sum of the grades of the two tests. The highest score is 16 in both the midterm and the final; therefore, the maximum overall grade is 32 (if greater than 30, it will be considered as 30 with honors).\nStudents may choose not to take the final exam in the above mentioned form (midterm and final), but rather a comprehensive exam at the end of the course. If so, the final exam will include 16 multiple-choice questions (1 point each) and 8 exercises (2 points each) to be answered in 50 minutes. The maximum grade is 32 (if greater than 30, it will be considered as 30 with honors).\nPlease note that to be admitted to the class tests (both the midterm and the final), students must register themselves via Almaesami.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nGoal of this course is to allow the participants to get exposed to problems of business-to-business and business-to-consumer marketing from the seller's as well as from the buyer's perspective. \nThe course has both a methodological and an applied orientation, it introduces the concepts and methods of data analysis for marketing decisions and apply them to the main areas of marketing decision making. \nThe course relies on readings, case studies, computer lab exercises and team work assignments that help students understand how specific methods pay off in terms of better targeting and increased customer profitability. \nBy the end of the course, the students are expected to:\n- apply relevant concepts of business analysis to marketing problems, with specific emphasis on CRM decisions (Customer Lifetime Value estimation, customer satisfaction measurement and related managerial implications);\n- develop concepts and approaches underlying strategic and tactical decisions in business-to-business and business-to-consumer marketing;\n- be familiar with different types of real world data, and some advanced statistical techniques that can be applied to analyze customer-level data;\n- be trained on tools and skills needed to evaluate the appropriateness, performance, and value of different marketing models.\nCourse contents\nModule 1 (Gian Luca Marzocchi)\nIn mature and highly competitive markets the concept of customer satisfaction as a fundamental precursor of loyalty, profitability and customer value plays a central role in the implementation of successful business models. While finding new customers is vital, it is important to realize that retaining current customers is much less expensive than to finding new customers. It is therefore no surprise that a great deal of attention has been recently brought to the issue of designing and establishing formal systems able to bring the “voice of the customer” into the business/marketing decision-making processes. The purpose of the course is to make participants understand and appreciate the relative strengths and weaknesses of a variety of customer value and customer satisfaction measurement approaches and instruments available today. A key element in this process is measuring customer satisfaction through market research. As such, the course will focus on the understanding and the actual implementation of the customer satisfaction measurement practices currently employed in business environment. The links existing between Customer Satisfaction scores, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) instruments and Customer Profitability results will be explored in depth, in order to create an understanding of how companies, service organizations and retail banks translate CS measurement in actual commercial strategies and decisions.\nAt the end of this course participants will be able to:\n• Understand the meaning of (and the relations between) customer satisfaction, CRM and loyalty\n• Evaluate the main techniques available to measure customer satisfaction\n• Design customer satisfaction measurement processes\n• Recognize how customer satisfaction impacts profitability\n• Identify the main issues involved in customer satisfaction (and dissatisfaction) management\nGeneral plan of class meetings:\nWeek 1. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Customer relationship management (CRM) – Measuring CLV\nWeek 2. Measuring Customer Satisfaction: theory and methods. Designing and implementing a CS survey.\nWeek 3. Designing and implementing a CS survey (cont'd)\nWeek 4. Measuring Customer Satisfaction: the Trim Grid approach.\nWeek 5. The Trim Grid at Work: cases and examples – CS project presentations\n \nModule 2 (Gabriele Pizzi)\nThis module provides a theoretical and methodological approach to customer value measurement. More specifically, the course will deal with the way managers can\na) MEASURE the value for the customer by assessing homogeneous segments of customers seeking similar benefits from the product/service or exhibiting similar profiles;\nb) DELIVER value to the customer through distribution channels; and\nc) OBTAIN value from the customer through pricing and promotion strategies.\nThe module is very practical in nature and is aimed to provide students with rigorous methodological tools to analyze the different areas that contribute to creating value for the customer and to obtain value from the customer. Therefore, the theoretical foundations examined in class will be translated into the marketing practice by means of class exercises in the lab.\nCourse contents\n1) Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning\n2) Cluster analysis and customer segmentation\n3) Survey Preparation\n4) Multi-dimensional scaling and perceptual maps\n5) Pricing and Promotion Strategies\n6) Conjoint Analysis and pricing/product decision\n7) Customer Satisfaction measurement and analysis\n8) Web Analytics\n \nReadings/Bibliography\nModule 1 (Gian Luca Marzocchi)\nA reading package will be made available by the instructor at the beginning of the course\n \nModule 2 (Gabriele Pizzi)\nThe course is mainly practical in its nature. Therefore, the best way to learn is actively participate in class discussion and laboratory exercises. Lecture slides can be used as a tool to support learning in class. There are not mandatory readings for this course. However, students might make reference to the following two books aimed to deepening either the theoretical concepts or the methodological issues.\n1) Winer & Dhar – Pearson Ed. “Marketing Management (4th Edition)\n2) Mazzocchi, M.

As for the grading policy, the course evaluation is made of: 40% group assignments and 60% final individual examination.\n\nThe final examination will consist of open-ended questions and/or short analytical exercises concerning the topics discussed during the course.\n \nModule 2 (Gabriele Pizzi)\nThough not compulsory, participation in team-work assignments is strongly encouraged. Team-work assignments consist of:\nOne final team-work project: students will be asked to work in group on a project (i.e. analyzing an industry by segmenting customers and mapping the positioning of the main players in the industry) and to present in class the results and the managerial consequences of their project.\nCourse evaluation will be different depending on the eventual participation in team-work assignment, as detailed in the following:\n \nStudents participating in team-work assignments:\n70% final written exam\n30% team-work assignment\n \nStudents who do not participate in team-work assignments:\n\n100% final written exam\nThe final written exam for Customer Value Management (Module 2) will consist of the interpretation of a couple of SPSS outputs by proposing a) the conclusions that can be drawn from the data, and b) the managerial consequences of the findings reported on the outputs, backed by the theory studied in class.\n \nThe grades of the two modules will be averaged to compute the final grade of the complete Customer Value Management class.\n \nTeaching tools\nSlides, PC, statistical and IT tools\n \nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Gian Luca Marzocchi\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Gabriele Pizzi"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe aim of the course is to build capacity in using data to inform evidence-based decision-making. The course will provide students with a broad overview of tools and methods for data analysis and applied empirical research, with a particular focus on the estimation of causal effect of public policies. Students will analyze real-word datasets and will be guided through case studies from a variety of policy domains. By the end of the course students will be able to perform a basic – yet rigorous – analysis of data to better understand policy choices. They will gain enough data science literacy to interpret and judge the quality of existing empirical research and to communicate the results to decision makers and the public.\nCourse contents\nThe main topics are:\n\nWhat is a policy evaluation: ex-ante and ex-post evaluation\nMonitoring, outcome, output and impact evaluation\nObserved, experimental and quasi-experimental data\nSteps in conducting an evaluation analysis\nCounterfactual\nConditioning and instrumental variables\nRegression Discontinuity Design\nDifference-in-difference methods\nPropensity Score Matching method\n\n \nNote on prerequisites: students are required to have a foundational understanding of the R programming language and basic concepts of simple linear regression models. These prerequisites ensure that participants can effectively engage with the course material and fully benefit from the advanced topics covered.\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe course is mainly based on:\n\nGertler, Paul J., Sebastian Martinez, Patrick Premand, Laura B. Rawlings, and Christel M. J. Vermeersch. Impact Evaluation in Practice, second edition.

For this reason, attendance to the lectures is warmly recommended.\n\nStudents will receive data and learn how to use the basic tools to perform their own empirical projects. To this aim, the course involves some lab sessions using the econometric software STATA, which is available to them through the University of Bologna CAMPUS license.\nAssessment methods\nThe exam is closed book and assesses both the acquired knowledge of theoretical concepts and the ability to apply the methods learned and to interpret the estimation results in the light of the underlying theory.\n The full exam lasts 1 hour and 30 and is divided into two components.\nThe first one is mainly theoretical and entails:\n\n3 true or false questions with explanation\n2 open questions\n\n\nThe second one is empirical and contains 5 interpretation questions whose answers are based on a STATA regression output (received from the instructor). \n There will be one mid-term and one final exam lasting 1 hour, with the same structure.

To this end, he/she must email a request to the instructor within the date set for registration. The instructor will confirm reception of the request within the same date.\nIn case the student sit for the mid-term and the final, the course grade will be the average of the two exams. Rejection is intended with respect to the whole exam. If the grade is rejected, the student must retake the full exam (on the whole program). The only grade that can be rejected without any communication from the student is the one of the mid-term: when the student wants to reject the mid-term grade, she/he will simplu have to sit the full exam (tloosing the grade obtained in the first mid-term).\nThere will be 4 exercise sessions during which students will be asked do solve simple empirical exercices working in groups using the software STATA. Every exercise is worth maximum 0.5 points (in case it is correct) that will be added to the written exam grade. Handing in the whole 4 exercises students can earn up to 0.5*4=2 extra points.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nIn this course the student learns the basic econometric tools useful for a proper empirical analysis of economic phenomena. \nAt the end of the course the student is able to: \n- Critically evaluate the application and empirical economic literature; \n- Apply the basic econometric methods to conduct empirical analysis (forecasts and estimates) in the economic field with the use of an appropriate econometric software.\nCourse contents\nTopics discussed during the first part of the course (first subcycle):\n1.

Special emphasis will be placed on the economic interpretation of the results. Attending classes is important especially to learn the empirical topics of the course. At the end of each lecture an exercise will be assigned to students and its solution will be discussed at the start of the following lecture. These \"at home\" exercises do not concur to the final grade.\nAssessment methods\nThe exam, which is partly theoretical and partly empirical, tests the ability to apply the methods learnt to simulated or real data, using the R software, the acquired knowledge of the theoretical concepts and the ability to interpret estimation results in the light of the underlying theory.\nBoth the midterms and the total are written. It lasts one hour and it is composed of two distinct sections.\n\nThe first one is mainly theoretical, and it contains 5 multiple choice questions. The second one is mainly empirical, and it contains 11 questions whose answers shoud be computed using R and knowledge of the empirical analysis discussed during classes. Whatever the section, each correct answer yields two points; no penalty is applied to wrong answers. The final mark is the total number of point obtained in the two sections.\nDuring the exam it is forbidden to consult notes, slides, books, pocket calculators and any other electronic devices. The purpose of the exam is to ascertain that students acquired the knowledge required to correctly specify, estimate and test the econometric models discussed during the lectures and possess the ability to properly interpret the results provided by these procedures.\nStudents can reject the grade obtained at the exam once. To this end, he/she must email a request to the instructor within the date set for registration. The instructor will confirm reception of the request within the same date.\nRejection is intended with respect to the whole exam, whose grade is the average of the grades obtained in the two mid-terms. If the grade is rejected, the student must retake the full exam (consisting of both parts). The only grade that can be rejected without any communication from the student is the one of the first mid-term: in this case the student can either take the second mid-term or sit the full exam (thus losing the grade obtained in the first mid-term).\nStudents sitting the first mid-term can take the second mid-term on the first examination date set for the full exam, right at the end of the course, or on the following call. A student can sit the second mid-term only once; if he/she fails or rejects the grade obtained, he/she will have to resit the full exam and will lose the grade obtained in the first mid-term.\nIn case online exams will be envisaged by the University of Bologna, the structure of the written exam is the same. The exam will be run through Zoom and Exams Online (EOL). Detailed instructions on how to manage and hand in the online exam will be available on the course page on the VIRTUALE platform.\nThe maximum possible score is 30 cum laude, in case all anwers are correct, complete and formally rigorous.\nThe grade is graduated as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\nTeaching tools\nDedicated page on the VIRTUALE platform containing:\n\nNews and updated information\nLectures slides\nR lab material\n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Sergio Pastorello"

There will be a class lecture (3 hours) and a computer lab practice (3 hours) each week. Overall, there will be 10 lectures in class (30 hours) and 10 lectures in the lab (30 hours) but laboratory will be concentrated toward the end of the course.\nSoftware STATA: available for students of the Department of Economics (CAMPUS license) and at the Computer Lab of the School of Economics and Management.\nI will experimentally adopt innovative teaching tools (such as peer instruction; see link with reference) using adequate techical support during lectures relying for instance on free available software such as Pingo (https://pingo.upb.de/) and Kahoot! (https://kahoot.com/). Students do not need to install the software ahead but need to have a device (mobile phone or laptop) who can access internet during the lectures in which this approach will be implemented.\nIn addition, peer education requires a great deal of investment from students as students have to read the textbook before coming to class.\nAs concerns the teaching methods of this course unit, all students must attend Module 1, 2 [https://www.unibo.it/en/services-and-opportunities/health-and-assistance/health-and-safety/online-course-on-health-and-safety-in-study-and-internship-areas] on Health and Safety online\nAssessment methods\n1 hour written exam (30 points final exam or 15+15 intermediate exams) with open and multiple choice questions on theory and pratcical exercises using STATA.

Points awarderd for corrected answers to each question will be available.\nStudents can either take the exam at the end of the course on the full program or take two intermediate exams. If the student fails on at least one of the intermediate exams, he will have to take the full exam: there are no re-takes for intermediate exams\nThe final exam mark is the sum of the two intermediate exams' marks. The final mark ranges between 0 and 32; each intermediate exam is worth between 0 and 16 points (the range of points awarded for each question will be updated accordingly). To pass the final exam, both intermediate exam marks should be higher than 7 and their sum should be at least 18: eg. one fails, if his score is 7+7=14; one passes if the score is 7+11=18.\nSince there are no re-takes for the intermediate exams, a student who fails the first or second intermediate exam, will have to take the full final exam.\nStudents with final number of points 32 qualify for getting the mark 30 cum laude. 30 cum laude could be awarded to students scoring between 30 and 32 points.\nAccording to the indications of the council of the School of Economics and Management, the indications on the graduation of the grade are reported.\n• <18 insufficient\n• 18-23 sufficient\n• 24-27 good\n• 28-30 excellent\n• 30 cum laude excellent with praise (honors)\nIn the event of substantial restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the assessment methods might have to be adapted to online exam session and might be reviewed accordingly, giving prior notice to students. The topics tested (theory arguments and practical exercises with software) remain confirmed even in the case of different examination modes.\nTeaching tools\nSlides, teaching material , practice in the lab.\nSelf-evaluation on-line tests will be made available through the e-learning platform (https://virtuale.unibo.it/ ) and/or relying on mcEmpirics [https://www.mcempirics.com/] (instructions given at the beginning of the class).\nLectures involve the presentation of theoretical and applied issues of the various econometric methods. Applications are discussed in class and replicated during the computer laboratory session using STATA.\nThe course consists of 60 hours.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course aims to provide a methodological and applied overview of the modern econometric methods for decision-making in a number of contexts (investment, financing, innovating, etc.). A central role is played by panel data, in which at least two dimensions of observations are present: classically, we can have cross-sectional time series data (CSTS); recently, the multiple aspects of economic decisions emerge from multilevel data, such as firms within industries within regions within countries, observed over time. A pervasive aspect of the methods will concern the measurement of complex phenomena, such as heterogeneity, innovation and intangibles, uncertainty and disagreement.\nCourse contents\nThe course aims to provide a discussion of some alternative methodological and empirical analyses available with panel data.\n\nIt begins by considering panel data as suitable for multilevel models, where one wants to take into account the different levels of aggregation that may be present in the data.\nIt then moves on to examine estimates of heterogeneous parameters through meta-analysis, where regression can be used to study the relationship between covariates and effect size.\n\nApplications will be based on topics such as corporate capital structure, green innovation and the role of uncertainty perception.\n\nClearly there are necessary prerequisities, specifically for Erasmus students:\n1. At this page you can take a look at the content of courses like Econometrics for Individual Data, Corporate governance: an international perspective, International accounting, Industrial Economics, Python for Economists, Environmental Economics. \n2.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe aim of the course is to introduce students to a discussion of comparative economic theories. The main areas that will be covered\nare: (i) economic systems and reduction of complexity: introduction to comparative economic theories; (ii) paradigms of economic theory: the exchange model and the production model; (iii) economic theories and institutional assumptions: separation theorems; (iv) connections, social norms, institutional set-ups.\nThe course endeavours to provide systematic guidelines for the assessment of economic knowledge and the interpretation of  economic literature. This is done through the discussion of analytical themes central in the evolution of the discipline, and the reconstruction of how they stand vis-à-vis each other. Teaching consists of formal lectures and classes that require the active participation of students.\nCourse contents\nThe course ‘Foundational ideas in economics’ is an historical introduction to the main controversies that constitute the core of economic thinking since the 18th century. \nThe course is structured around a chronological overview of the development of economics as a discipline followed by a series of sessions on topics. The chronological overview will follow the evolution of the discipline since its origins to the current state of the profession. The course will be organised around 9 topics: wealth, trade, value, market, crisis, inequality, labour, externalities, and development. \nReadings/Bibliography\nIn addition to the texts included in the syllabus, the students can consult the following resources: \n\nBackhouse, Roger. 2023.

The goal is to equip student with the capacity to read primary sources and understand their contexts. \nThe course will then proceed in a series of sessions devoted to different ideas. One session will be devoted to each topic. Each session will be divided in two parts: the first will be a traditional lecture format with discussion; the second will be devoted to students’ presentations and debates.\nAssessment methods\nGrades will be assigned based on students' presentations in class and written exam at the end of the year. Each evaluation will count for 1/2 of the final mark.\nThe maximum possible score is 30 cum laude, in case all anwers are correct, complete and formally rigorous.\nThe grade is graduated as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\nStudents can reject the grade obtained at the exam once.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nIn recent years, first in markets for trust services (financial, insurance, health, education, social) and then in markets for ordinary services and durable goods, quantitative indicators have been developed to reduce information asymmetries, to foster competition and, more generally, to promote allocative efficiency. The increased availability of data on the characteristics of services and goods, as well as of their users, is likely to lead to a further increase in the use of these indicators and therefore to a growing need to verify their allocative effects. Moreover, there will be rising problems due to potential conflicts of interest on the head of the third-party certifiers.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe student explores the many dimensions of new venture creation & growth and acquires the capability to foster innovation and new business formations in independent and corporate settings. He is concerned with content and process questions as well as with formulation and implementation issues that relate to conceptualizing, developing and managing successful new ventures. As part of this learning journey the student acquires tools and methdologies required to design a solid business plan around an original idea that she/he is asked to develop, articulate and present in collaboration with her/his team members.\nCourse contents\nThe emphasis in this course is on applying and synthesizing concepts and techniques from different functional areas in the context of new venture development. The class sessions are designed to familiarize you with the many dimensions of entrepreneurship and new venture development.\nCore topics include:\n- entrepreneur\n- business idea\n- entrepreneurial strategy\n- business model\n- venturing mindset\n- customer development\nImportant pedagogical objectives of the course are:\n- “Experience the process”: identify and pursue a business opportunity in either an independent or corporate setting with a team of motivated peers;\n- To acquire the knowledge and spirit for venturing;\n- To think creatively and to solve problems in highly unstructured situations;\n- To examine the totality of a business proposal rather than concentrate on single aspects such as the marketing issues, or the financial feasibility.\nWhile most of the examples in class will be drawn from new venture formation, the principles also apply to entrepreneurship in corporate settings and to non-profit entrepreneurship.\nReadings/Bibliography\nEntrepreneurship (module 1)\nAttending students: Reading package; Case study package\nNon attending students: Above material plus text book: \"New Venture Creation\", by Timmons & Spinelli , McGraw-Hill - Any edition from the 8th on.\nNew Venture Implementation (module 2)\nAttending students: Slides; Readings package; Case study package\nNon attending students: Non-attending students will have to prepare selected chapters (1-2-5-6-7-8-9-10-16-18-19) from the book \"Successful business plan. Secrets and strategies\" by Rhonda Abrams, Planning shop (6th edition onwards), as well as the slides, readings and case study package uploaded on Virtuale. These students will be evaluated on the basis of a written exam.\nTeaching methods\nThe most effective way to understand the entrepreneurial process is to take a hands-on approach. In this course students are expected to interact with the business community, be able to work effectively in teams, and be active participants in classroom discussions. Attending students will be working in teams, to be formed during module 1, during both modules. For module 2, teams will be asked to develop a new venture plan based on new venture ideas selected during session 2 of module 2.\nStrong written and oral skills greatly facilitate success in starting a new venture. Those individuals that can effectively communicate their ideas will have an advantage over those that cannot. As such, the assignments in the course center on written and oral presentations.\nWe will often break class into two sections, with outside speakers for at least one of the sections, or time for team meetings. Several classes will have “stand up” sessions where team members will present a portion of their plan.\n            \n            \n                Assessment methods\nEntrepreneurship (module 1)\nAttending students \nA final written exam plus assessment of team-based assignments. The final output of the team effort will be a startup case report. Team and individual performance will be measured along with the written report in determining the final grade of each student.\nTypical breakdown of the final score:\n40% case report\n40% written exam\n20% final presentation\nNon attending students\nA written exam based on all the material covered during the course (lecture slides, readings, case studies) plus the text book: \"New Venture Creation\", by Timmons & Spinelli , McGraw-Hill - Any edition from the 8th on.\nNew Venture Implementation (module 2)\n\nAttending students will be evaluated on the basis of a group work (i.e., the new venture plan). For this assignment, students working in teams will submit a written document to the instructor before the end of the course (deadlines to be announced in class). The plan will be presented by each team at the end of the course. At the individual level, students will be evaluated on the basis of an individual written test. Non-attending students will be evaluated on the basis of a written exam.\nAttending students: new venture plan (70% of final mark), individual written test (30% of final mark)\nNon attending students: written exam (100% of final mark)\nThe final grading (grading scale 0-30) will follow the criteria indicated below:\n\n<18 insufficient\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good \n28-30 very good \n30 e lode excellent\n\nStudents with specific learning disorders (SLD) or temporary/permanent disabilities should contact the appropriate University office (https://site.unibo.it/studenti-con-disabilita-e-dsa/en ) immediately and agree with the teacher the most effective strategies for attending the lectures and preparing for the exam.\n\nTeaching tools\nThe learning experience will be aided through the employment of a variety of teaching tools, including:\na) videos\nb) simulations\nc) live case studies\nStudents are expected to synthesize and integrate knowledge acquired in other courses and put it into practice. They will be challenged to shift from being a receiver of ideas, facts, concepts and techniques, to a style of generating ideas, identifying problems, analyzing and evaluating alternatives, and formulating workable action plans.\nBecause the course will make significant use of online simulations it is expected that 20 to 30% of lecture will be delivered fully onlin\n\nTeaching assistant:TBD\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Simone Ferriani\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Leonardo Corbo"

This course analyses different topics that link company performance to financial information at multiple levels. \nThe course starts with an introduction to fundamental concepts of what kind of financial information are usually reported in a full financial reporting disclosure. Each document will be analyzed in its content to understand structure and detect the key performance indicators (KPI) it contains. \nStudents will, discover what's behind the numbers in financial statements, such as balance sheets, income statements and Cash flow statements ; will also understand how to read them with support of the Notes and the Management report, so to be able to use the information these documents provide from different perspective. \nStarting from financial information the course will analyse the identification of the key information useful for measuring the value of a company and determining the main indicators of its economic performance. Having defined these fundamentals, the main criteria used to measure the value of a business will be reviewed, with particular emphasis on profit and multiples methods, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. The discussion of operational cases will enable students to acquire a right level of sensitivity in the critical analysis of business value assessment reports, and in company valuations in general. In the final session of the course, focus will be made on part of a M&A process, where the \"information memorandum\" plays usually an important role, being the document aimed at presenting the company as a target to an audience of potential investors, emphasising not only its quantitative information but also to its qualitative contents.\nReadings/Bibliography\nCourse material consists of slides, case studies and course textbooks (see below).\nWith reference to textbooks, relevant chapters will be indicated at the beginning of the courses.\nAll teaching material (except for textbooks and academic articles) will be available online at virtuale.unibo.it. \nCourse textbook: \nP.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nSuccessful innovation involves convincing others to provide the resources needed to implement new ideas. The course is aimed at providing the fundamentals of innovation financing, from the perspective of new and small firms, by integrating theory with empirical studies and case-studies. At the end of the course students will gain an understanding of the determinants of the choice among different financing models and achieve a good command of the best practices in the successful implementation of innovative ideas. \nIn relation to Joint Ventures (JVs), students will focus their attention on the possibility for small firms to engage in a business agreement with other firms for the purpose of developing innovative projects. For the case of venture capital financing, students will be introduced from a comparative perspective to the procedures followed by venture capital firms when financing start-ups and early stage ventures. As for crowdfunding, students will learn about four different models: reward, equity, P2P lending, and charity.\nCourse contents\nThe course balances learning of concepts, development of analytical skills and practice in the financial management of start-ups, JVs, and SMEs involved in innovative activities. Besides focusing on some distinctive features of innovation financing from the perspective of the firm, the course explores this issue also from the perspective of investors. On the one side, it highlights strengths and weaknesses of ‘control rights’ theories of financing, in which firms follow an established hierarchy of preferences for modes of financing. On the other side, it discusses strengths and weaknesses of public policies supporting the creation of new technology-based firms and the formation of Research Joint Ventures (RJVs). The topics and practical approaches will consider the unique differences between developing the entrepreneurial free-standing business and the corporate intrapreneurial development of new divisions, business units or product lines within a parent organization.\nIn some lessons, the instructor will delve into specific aspects of financing innovative activities with the help of experts and industry insiders from the private equity and consulting sectors.\nReadings/Bibliography\nLerner, J., A.

The first part (coursework) involves preparing a 10-15 minute video in which the strengths and weaknesses of a research paper published in an international scientific journal are presented and discussed. Each video will be created in collaboration by at least two students. The papers will be made available to the students at the beginning of the course. The second part consists of a written final exam in which students will have to answer 5 out of 8 (both open-ended and multiple-choice) questions.\nFor students unable to attend the classes, the final exam will consist of 8 open-ended questions and 4 multiple-choice questions that they will have to answer.\nGrading criteria:\n18-23: the student has sufficient preparation and analytical skills, spread however, over just few topics taught in the course, the overall jargon is correct\n24-27: the student shows and adequate preparation at a technical level with some doubts over the topics. Good, yet not to articulate analytical skills with the use of a correct jargon\n28-30: Great knowledge about most of the topics taught in the course, good critical and analytical skills, good usage of the specific jargon\n30L: excellent and in depth knowledge of all the topics in the course, excellent critical and analytical skills, excellent usage of specific jargon.\nTeaching tools\n            \n            \n                Teaching tools\nOther teaching material, including slides used during the lectures and papers will be made available to students on a weekly basis through the 'Virtuale' platform.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Enrico Santarelli"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe aim of the course is to introduce the basic approaches to forecast economic variables with statistical models over short horizons, and with structural models over the long run. At the end of the course, students will be able to make their own model-based ex ante forecasts, and to evaluate the ex post forecasting ability of the professional forecasters activity.\nCourse contents\nAn introductory picture of forecasting in business and economics (FBE): governing many trade-offs\nBridge models as static/dynamic single-equation models: problems and advantages (GM, 1-3, 5\nMidas models: relationships at mixed frequency of observations (GM, 12)\nFactor models vs regressors’ selection algorithms: the curse of dimensionality (GM, 13)\nBayesian estimates to tackle the curse of dimensionality: from VAR to BVAR models (GM, 6-8)\nMacroeconometric models and the amount of economic theory: RBC, DSGE and Hybrid-VECM\nForecast evaluation and combination for better predictions (GM, 4)\nnote: “GM, #” refers to single chapters of FBE course textbook, see below\nReadings/Bibliography\nBasic textbook:\nEric Ghysels and Massimiliano Marcellino, Applied Economic Forecasting using Time Series Methods, Oxford University Press, 2018 (referred to as GM).\nPlease note that chapters 1-3, 5, and 7 (excluding empirical examples) of GM must be read in advance (i.e., before the beginning of FBE lectures), as they review the main content of the Time Series Econometrics course from the first year.\nFurther readings will be provided during the lectures.\nTeaching methods\nDuring each of the 5 weeks of the FBE course, there will be 6 hours of traditional in-person teaching using a blackboard and slides.\nAdditionally, scheduled online meetings will be held every week to illustrate EViews applications and to assess your home assignments.\nAssessment methods\nA number of home assignments will be given during FBE. They must be completed weekly and will account for 50% of the grade. This approach ensures students are engaged throughout FBE and encourages active participation in all in-person lectures, as well as a number of online meetings.\nIn addition, there will be a final in-person exam, which accounts for the remaining 50% of FBE grade.\nStudents who do not attend all FBE lectures and online meetings are required to take a comprehensive written exam in person, covering all FBE topics.\nGrades of FBE assessment: <18: not sufficient; 18-23: sufficient; 24-27: good; 28-30: very good; 30 e lode:outstanding.\nNote for Erasmus (International) Students:\nSince FBE is closely related to the content of the first-year \"Time Series Econometrics\" (TSE) course, selecting FBE without a full understanding of TSE may result in problems and extra work due to the integration of both courses.\nTeaching tools\nOnline meetings and home assignments will utilize the EViews econometric software. The EViews 12 license is available in two ways:\n(1) Purchase the University Edition online for $49.95, or\n(2) Use the free EViews Student Version Lite.\nBoth options are illustrated at this link. \nAlternatively, home assignments can be completed using R, but R online tutorials will be not provided.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Roberto Golinelli"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe main objective of the course is to provide students with tools to think critically and autonomously about economic ideas. After completing the course, students are expected to be able to \n1)\tElaborate on a personal conceptual map of the history of the fundamental ideas of economic theory and policy\n2)\tCompare different economic models, theories, and interpretations in their respective social, political, and technical contexts and identify points of cohesion and points of contrast\n3)\tRead and analyse primary sources, articles, and models in its original context\n4)\tProduce a structured discourse using historical case-studies to discuss present day issues\nCourse contents\nThe course ‘Foundational ideas in economics’ is an historical introduction to the main controversies that constitute the core of economic thinking since the 18th century. \nThe course is structured around a chronological overview of the development of economics as a discipline followed by a series of sessions on topics. The chronological overview will follow the evolution of the discipline since its origins to the current state of the profession. The course will be organised around 9 topics: wealth, trade, value, market, crisis, inequality, labour, externalities, and development. \nReadings/Bibliography\nIn addition to the texts included in the syllabus, the students can consult the following resources: \n\nBackhouse, Roger. 2023. The Penguin History of Economics. London: Penguin. \nKuiper, Edith. 2022. A Herstory of Economics. John Wiley & Sons.\n Roncaglia, Alessandro. 2009. The Wealth of Ideas.

London: Wiley.\n\nTeaching methods\nThis course is taught entirely in English.\nThere is no pre-requisite knowledge needed for the course\n\nThere will be two mandatory readings for each topic consisting of one primary source and one article or chapter producing a reflexive analysis of the topic. The goal is to equip student with the capacity to read primary sources and understand their contexts. \nThe course will then proceed in a series of sessions devoted to different ideas. One session will be devoted to each topic. Each session will be divided in two parts: the first will be a traditional lecture format with discussion; the second will be devoted to students’ presentations and debates.\nAssessment methods\nGrades will be assigned based on students' presentations in class and written exam at the end of the year. Each evaluation will count for 1/2 of the final mark.\nThe maximum possible score is 30 cum laude, in case all anwers are correct, complete and formally rigorous.\nThe grade is graduated as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\nStudents can reject the grade obtained at the exam once. To this end, they must email a request to the instructor within the date set for registration. The instructor will confirm reception of the request within the same date.\nNon-attending students should contact the professor at the beginning of the course. \n\nIn general, all information relative to exams will be send on the Virtuale page of the course. \n\nTeaching tools\nAll information on the content, methods and tips, and the assessment of the course will be via the Virtuale platform, including the communication for non-attending students.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Cleo Faiza Layla Chassonnery Zaigouche"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe students learn to interpret and understand the process of globalization from the viewpoint of international trade in goods and services and factor movements. They learn the causes and consequences of international trade, the effects of trade policies, the causes of international factor movement and multinational operations, and the role of the World Trade Organization. Upon completing the course students will have acquired an empirical and theoretical understanding of the complex issues raised by the economic interdependence of nations and to analyze them in a systematic way.\nCourse contents\nThe course initially focuses on international trade theory and policy, addressing classic questions such as: who trades what with whom? What are the effects of trade on welfare and income distribution? How do micro-aspects influence international trade? The course explores these questions through the lenses of both classical and new trade theories. This theoretical journey concludes with an overview of recent research on the role of heterogeneous firms in international trade. Subsequently, the course applies these models to examine various aspects of globalization, including the role and impact of multinational companies in developed and developing countries, migration, and protectionism.\nReadings/Bibliography\nKrugman, P., M.

Students will also work in groups to produce presentations based on recent journal articles and op-eds.\nAssessment methods\nThe final grade will be based on a written exam, along with essays and team projects.\n\nThe grading scale is as follows:\n<18: Insufficient\n18-23: Sufficient\n24-27: Average/Good\n28-29: Very Good\n30: Excellent\n30 cum laude: Outstanding\nTeaching tools\nSlides based on the textbook and relevant articles will be made available on Virtuale.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Tommaso Sonno"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course the student has a good understanding of basic general equilibrium dynamic macroeconomic models, used by economists to analyze several theoretical and policy questions, and of modern growth theory. In particular, he/she: - knows and is able to solve analytically macroeconomic dynamic models (infinite horizons and overlapping generations); - knows the main empirical issues and theoretical models analyzed by modern growth theory; - is able to apply models to investigate comparative dynamics across countries and over time.\nCourse contents\nThe course presents topics in modern macroeconomic theory with a focus on long run issues. The first part of the course introduces the two basic macroeconomic models used to describe the economic system in a dynamic general equilibrium framework with optimizing agents. The second part of the course provides a systematic presentation of modern macroeconomic growth theory and analyzes the role of different factors in generating persistent disparities in income per capita across countries.\nTopics:\n\nStylized facts on economic growth and the neoclassical growth model. Dynamic macroeconomic models with optimizing agents. The representative agent model with infinite horizons. The overlapping generations model. The neoclassical growth model: theory and empirical evidence.\nEndogenous growth: competitive models of endogenous growth. Endogenous technical change\nPoverty traps. Multiple equilibria. Multiple steady states. \n\n \nReadings/Bibliography\nSuggested textbooks: \n\nDavid Romer, Advanced Macroeconomics, Mc Graw-Hill, 2019 (5th edition)\nBarro R. and X.

Home assignments. Review classes.\nAssessment methods\nThe final exam aims at verifying the acquisition of expected learning outcomes. The exam is written with essay-type, true and false, analytical-type questions (three questions: the exam will not necessarily include a question per type; more than one question per type may be included). Questions and problems aim at verifying knowledge of the main macroeconomic dynamic models, of the empirical issues and of theoretical models analyzed by modern growth theory, and the ability to apply these models to understand and investigate comparative dynamics across countries and over time.\nIndividual solutions to assignments, handed out during lectures, may contribute to assessment, provided that all assignments and take-home exam are returned in due time and the exam is taken at the end of the course (April). Otherwise the exam grade is based entirely on a closed-book written exam.\nRequirements on assignments and take home exam and exam grading rules will be communicated in class and published on Virtuale in the course's syllabus at the beginning of the course.\n \nThe maximum possible score is 30 cum laude, in case all anwers are correct, complete and formally rigorous.\nThe grade is graduated as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\nFor students who take Growth Theory as part of the integrated course Macroeconomics A, the grade obtained in Growth Theory will contribute to the final grade of the integrated course. This is obtained as the average of the grades of Macroeconomics and Growth Theory.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course focusses on how to shape healthcare systems and organizations to improve health outcomes relying on health services research and the management of human resources. At the end of the course, the student will be familiar with a set of economic and interdisciplinary tools that provide a rigorous framework to understand the role of health services research and to model decision-making in healthcare organizations. \nIn particular, the course will use economic theory, selected empirical evidence and case studies to outline the tradeoffs implied in alternative financial mechanisms and organizational designs, and to foster innovation and human resource management.\nThe specific topics considered vary over time, but they will include the organization of integrated care under the paradigm of patient-centered healthcare systems, the tools to foster appropriateness in clinical practice, the role of medical research in evolving healthcare systems; the recruitment and training of healthcare personnel; the role of workforce incentives. \nThe student acquires competencies in: 1) analysing current and new models in healthcare financing and management and their implications for equity of access, cost, and quality of care; 2) understanding and modelling the links between organizational settings, workforce incentives and health outcomes; 3) applying different methods to evaluate innovations in health programs and policies.\nCourse contents\nLong term sustainability of health care systems\nPopulation health management\nThe organization of primary and intermediate care\nThe role of clinical governance tools\nThe funding and organization of biomedical research\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe reading list and the slides are available on Virtuale.\nTeaching methods\nClasses and discussions.\nAssessment methods\nStudents regularly attending the lectures can take the exam discussing a presentation on one of the themes dealt with during the course. Those who do not choose to give the presentation have to take a written test to assess their ability to critically evaluate some of the themes discussed during the course. In the written test, students are given outlines to develop short essays in two hours. Students can choose the approach that is more coherent with their own background. However, they are expected to address the proposed themes with a good level of rigour and appropriateness and to take into consideration the interdisciplinary nature of the issues at stake. Evaluations for the final grade: Sufficient preparation only on a few questions, limited ability to perform a critical analysis of the literature, fairly appropriate technical language → 18-19; Fairly good preparation on most questions, good ability to perform a critical analysis of the literature, appropriate technical language → 20-24; Good preparation on all questions, very good ability to perform a critical analysis of the literature, good mastery of technical language → 25-29; Exhaustive preparation on all questions, very good ability to perform a critical analysis of the literature and to develop connections between references, full mastery of the technical language → 30-30L.\nTeaching tools\nVideo projector.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Gianluca Fiorentini\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Pietro Biroli"

Drawing on cases and debates in arts and heritage, the course is focused on methodological issues affecting management discourse in historical terms. Managing (or organizing) is looked at as an element affecting ways in which arts & heritage are dealt with; and as sources itself of current days heritage.\nCourse contents\nThe course will investigate the complex relationship between heritage, history, and the issue of managing (or organizing). Drawing on cases and debates in arts and heritage, the course will focus on methodological issues affecting management discourse in historical terms. It is not focused on heritage history, nor on management history per se. Rather, aadministration (or the issue of managing/organizing) will be looked at as an element affecting ways in which arts & heritage are dealt with; and as sources itself of current days heritage. \n While getting substantive insights about important debates and controversies, the student will learn to deal with complex interdisciplinary research programs. The workshop is structured in 15 classes, each focused on a particularly intriguing example of a complex relationship between the three elements (heritage, history, and managing). Through international video conferences, experts on particular topics will be involved in most of the classes. The course presents a strong interdisciplinary character as well as a focus on international/global context.\n The course will intensively use images, videos, documentaries, on the assumption that new forms of communication in this field are already available, making it possible to integrate efforts done by others in documentary production. \n There is no effort in providing a systematic historical picture, but more simply a set of challenging chapters in the relationship between history, arts and management, keeping in mind specific researches I am familiar with. The precise list of topics will be identified later, depending on the availability of experts on various topics. A tentative list of the sessions, and the rational for using them, are provided here.

The course will introduce studnets to studying organisational issues related to incentives and agency theory.\nCourse contents\nLearning Outcomes\nAt the end of the course students should be able to:\n- describe the basic questions, models, and methods asked in industrial organization\n- discuss the basic framework of competition policy, as applied to market definition, merger assessment, and anti-competitive behaviors\n- analyze market structure, using concentration measures and assessment of an industry’s structural factors\n- use basic game theoretic tools to analyze strategic situations\n- apply standard economic models to understand firm decisions and strate\nPrerequisites\nThe course assumes that students are familiar with basic microeconomic models (perfect competition, monopoly) and are comfortable with using algebra and basic calculus (e.g. linear systems of equations, derivatives and partial derivatives, optimization problems in one and two variables).\nCourse Contents\nThe course is taught in two modules. Module 1 focuses on providing students with the analytical tools used in Industrial Organization. Module 2 uses the tools taught in the first module to analyze industrial structure and firm strategy, through the lens of competition policy.\nThe topics covered in each module will include the following.\nModule 1: Theoretical Tools for Industrial Organization\n1. Review of consumer theory and producer theory\n2. Perfect competition and efficiency\n3. Monopoly and market power\n4. Game theory: games in normal form, Nash Equilibrium\n5. Theories of Oligopoly: Bertrand and Cournot competition\n6. Game theory: games in extensive form, Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium, games in repeated form\n7. Theories of Oligopoly: collusion when interactions are repeated\nModule 2: Market Power in Practice\n8. Competition policy and regulation\n9. Measuring market structure and market Power\n10. Horizontal and vertical Mergers\n11. Market foreclosure and anticompetitive behavior\n12. Pricing strategies: Predatory pricing, price discrimination, and non-linear pricing\n13. Non-pricing firm strategy: Branding and product differentiation\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe main text book for the course will be:\nL. Cabral, Introduction to Industrial Organization, second edition, MIT Press, 2017.\nAdditional materials may be drawn on for specific parts of the course. These will be announced in class.\nTeaching methods\nStandard frontal teaching. Students with disabilities or specific learning disabilities (DSA) are expected to request appropriate accommodations as early as possible during the class so adjustments can be made accordingly.\nAssessment methods\nThe course will be evaluated using written exams, conducted in presence. They will last approximately 60-90 minutes and will include a combination of exercises and other questions.\nIn order to pass the written exam, students have two possibilities:\n1. Take only the general exam in December, January, or September.\n2. Take the partial midterm exam at the end of Module 1 and a second partial midterm exam in December or January (of the same academic year).\nEach module will be graded separately, out of 16. The total score for the course will be the sum of the scores received for each module. Students must pass both modules (i.e., receive a minimum score of 9 in each) to pass the course. In addition to the written exam, there may be an option to receive points through class engagement.\nStudents may only enrol in a midterm exam if they have not enrolled in any previous exam in this course (either the midterm or the final). Students can reject their final grade once. To reject their grade, they must complete the online form provided by the instructor after the exam, within the relevant time period (any such requests submitted by email may be ignored unless otherwise stated).\nThe grade is scaled as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\nTeaching tools\nTextbook, slides and exercises.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Jonathan Neil Chapman\n                    \n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Annalisa Loviglio"

Is there a ranking across the aforementioned range of environmental policies?\n2. How intense is the impact of industry structure and the nature of market competition (either in prices or in quantities) on the investment in research and development delivering abatement or replacement technologies?\n3. May we achieve the the net zero emission target by correctly stimulating firms' reaction along the technological dimension?\n4.

Due attention will be paid to digitalisation and its main governing laws.\nThe module will introduce the basic concepts, the economics and the politics of international trade, and its legal order. Also, it will examine the law governing commercial contracts for international business, including choice and conflict of laws rules. The main global issues relating to digitalisation are covered. The concluding part of the first part will address the process of global digitalisation, its key role in commercial agreements, and the key laws to be aware of. Digitisation has significantly impacted international business. The module covers the impact of digitisation on trade in services, the ensuing concept of 'digital services' and the different types of trade barriers these services face.\nA part of the module aims at providing an understanding of the international dispute resolution system and offering candidates a basic understanding of the principles of good practice and procedure in international dispute management. After a general introduction of in-Court and out-of-Court mechanisms, this part of the module will concentrate on the general principles of international commercial arbitration and a comparison of the main alternative dispute resolution processes – arbitration, mediation and adjudication. It gives students the opportunity to analyse critically the use of arbitration to resolve international business and commercial disputes and provides them with a contextual analysis of international commercial arbitration through lectures, class readings, seminar discussions and group presentations. The theoretical material will be combined with practical examples for a better understanding of the unique characteristics of international commercial arbitration. Overall, this part of the course will consider the ways in which the various benefits of international commercial arbitration and other hybrid dispute resolution methods can be combined to provide an effective, dynamic and integrated system of dispute resolution in international business and commerce. It purports to give candidates a basic understanding of the principles of good practice and procedure in international arbitration.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nThe module provides opportunities for students to develop and demonstrate knowledge and understanding, qualities, skills and other attributes in the following areas:\nA. Knowledge and Understanding\n\nDemonstrate a sound understanding of, and familiarity with, the basic structure and fundamental rules which govern modern trade, developing skills which are useful in the legal profession, as well as in business and administration.\nDemonstrate an understanding of the main features of international trade law and ability to recognise the connections between the substantive and theoretical issues linked to international trade law and policy.\nDemonstrate a critical approach to the themes discussed.\nDemonstrate an understanding of the rationales underlying the core principles of international commercial arbitration, as well as the underlying norms.\nDemonstrate an understanding and an ability to apply knowledge of principles of international commercial arbitration to a number of areas of law, as well as complex problem and essay questions.\n\nB. Cognitive (thinking) Skills\n\nDemonstrate an ability to analyse the relevant law.\nDemonstrate an ability to assess critically, where relevant, the law and policy underlying it.\n\nC. Other Skills and Attributes (Practical/Professional/Transferable)\n\nDemonstrate ability to research and assemble information and materials that are relevant to the law and, in some instances, policy.\nDemonstrate an ability to produce a structured, logical, analytical and accurately referenced synthesis of relevant materials.\nDemonstrate an ability to present cogent oral and written arguments\n\n \nIndicative content\nIntroduction.

Topics in the general area of trade theory and commercial policy include: determinants of trade flows, effects of trade on economic welfare and income distribution, efficiency and redistributive effects of tariff and nontariff protection of domestic industries, the theory of preferential trading agreements. Institutional topics include: the history of the global trading system, multilateral trade negotiations and the GATT/WTO system, empirical approaches to capturing trade patterns, and the regionalism movement. More specifically, the first part of the course will focus on theoretical frameworks designed to understand the drivers and implications of international trade(including the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage and the Heckscher-Ohlin model) and briefly review the empirical applications of these models. The second part of the course will cover distributional consequences of trade policy instruments, arguments for trade protection, and the organization of the world trade system.\nSome knowledge of the basic principles of microeconomics can be useful for this course, together with an understanding of high-school linear algebra and graph analysis using Cartesian axes. More advanced topics in microeconomics will be introduced throughout the course.\n \nCourse Outline \n1. Introduction to the World of International Economics. Early trade theories. The Classical Theory of Trade: The Ricardian Model.\n2. Extensions to the Ricardian Model: Wage and exchange rate limits, Transportation costs, Multiple Commodities and Countries.\n3.

Students are advised to read the material beforehand. The material pertaining to every single lecture is indicated in the detailed syllabus published in the website\nhttps://virtuale.unibo.it/\nat the beginning of the course.\nAssessment methods\nStudents attending lectures (for a minimum of 6 out of 10 lectures):\n1.Class attendance and participation (10%), assessing the ability to discuss the material during class discussions.\n2. Two Written tests (the first counting for 40% and the second for 50% of the final grade). \nEach test consists in a 1h15 mnts, closed-book written examination, evaluating the theoretical knowledge acquired during the course. More specifically, the test consists of 1 open question (with choice, 1 of 2 available questions, maximum 16 points) and 4 multiple-choice questions in which the student is asked to justify his/her answer based on the theory studied (with choice, 4 of 6 available multiple-choice questions, maximum 4 points each). The whole exam is worth a total of 32 points maximum. Students with 31 or 32 points get a \"30 cum laude\" mark.\n\nStudents not attending lectures:\nThe assessment will be 100% based on a 2-hour, closed-book written examination, testing the theoretical knowledge acquired during the course. The exam consists of 2 open questions (maximum 10 points each) and 6 multiple-choice questions (in which the student is asked to justify his/her answer based on the theory studied - maximum 2 points each) on the whole program. The whole exam is worth a total of 32 points maximum. Students with 31 or 32 points get a \"30 cum laude\" mark.\n\nScores\nIn their answers, students must prove a good mastering of the topics, ability to perform critical analysis and appropriate technical jargon.\nTherefore, excellence (16 points or cum laude in the open question and 4 points in the multiple-choice questions) is awarded to answers showing excellent mastering of the topic (exhaustive, correct, and complete), excellent analysis and perfect use of the jargon.\nVery good performance (14 - 15 points in the open question or 3/4 points in the multiple-choice questions) is achieved with correct, fully exhaustive, and complete answers, showing a very good critical thinking.\nGood performance (11 - 13 points in the open question or 3 points in the multiple-choice questions) is achieved with correct answers, showing a good level of completeness and exhaustivity and fairly good critical analysis.\nSufficiency (9 - 10 points in the open question or 2 points in the multiple-choice questions) is achieved with correct answers, showing a satisfactory ability to perform critical analysis and mostly correct jargon.\n \nNon programmable calculators are allowed during the exam. However, no substitutes (cell phones, tablets or similar) are permitted.\nTeaching tools\nSlides and other material will be available on the course website.\nDuring the first three weeks a tutor will offer 1-2 review sessions on the economic tools that the Professor will use in the remainder of the course.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Matteo Alvisi"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course students are able to analyze several issues related to macroeconomic policy in open economies and to the evolution of foreign exchange markets. Specifically, students are exsposed to the determination and dynamics of exchange rates, on the choice between flexible and fixed exchange rates, with special attention to the European Monetary Union, on the international role of the euro and its relationship with the dollar and, finally, on speculative attacks on currencies and the design of a new international financial architecture.\nCourse contents\nThe first part of the course focuses on international trade theory and policy. It addresses some of the classic questions of international trade theory such as: who trades what with whom? What are the effects of trade on welfare and the income distribution? How micro-aspects enter the picture of international trade? The course presents the answers of classical and new trade theory to these questions. The first part ends with an overview of recent theoretical and empirical research on the role of heterogeneous firms in international trade.\n\nThe second half of the course covers selected topics in the fields of trade policy and international macroeconomic. Some questions which will be tackled during this second part of the course will be: What are the effects of barriers to trade and economic integration? What about trade policies in developing countries? How are nominal exchange rates determined? What does it mean for a currency to be overvalued or undervalued? Why do countries run large current account surpluses or deficits? Are such external imbalances sustainable? Why do some fixed exchange rate regimes fail and end in a currency crisis?

The course will emphasize blending theory and data with real-world policies, events, and evidence. The course will discuss patterns of trade, the gains and losses from liberalizing or restricting trade, and the role of increasing returns. At the end of the course the student will be expected to become familiar with policy relevant questions concerning migrations, income distribution, multinational enterprises and ‘North-south’ issues. Protectionism, trade and the environment and the role of international institutions and agreements (the EU, the World Trade Organization (WTO)) will also be discussed.\nCourse contents\nThe course presents the main models and the empirical evidence related to\n1.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThis course deals with the macroeconomics of open economies. We will address issues such as the role of monetary and fiscal policy in an open economy, the determination of the balance of payments, the level of economic activity, and inflation, the choice between fixed versus flexible exchange rate, causes and effects of currency crises in emerging economies, the process of economic and monetary integration in Europe. At the end of the course, students will be able to understand the relationship between interest rates, exchange rates, and the balance of payments, how this relationship depends on the exchange rate regimes, and the possibilities and limitations of economic policy in a globalized world.\nCourse contents\n\nSome basic concepts in international finance: national and international accounts\nSome basic concepts in international finance: exchange rates and the foreign exchange market\nExchange rates I: the monetary approach in the long run\nExchange rates II: the asset approach in the short run\nBalance of payments: the gains from financial globalization\nExchange rates, interest rates and the trade balance\n\nThe debate on fixed vs. flexible exchange-rate regimes: international monetary experience\nExchange rate crises\nThe European Monetary Union.

Taylor, International Macroeconomics, 5th edition, Worth Publishers, 2021.\nTeaching methods\nClass lectures. Although not compulsory, participation to classes is highly recommended to help dealing with the course's requirements\nAssessment methods\nStudents' assessment will be based on a closed-book written test, aimed at evaluating their comprehension of the main concepts developed throughout the course. It will also assess students' ability to analyze current real-world issues and problems, related to international economics and finance.\nAfter the first half of classes, students have the opportunity to take a mid-term exam, followed by a final exam at the end of classes. Both tests will last 75 minutes and consist of a true/false section and one open-ended question. The final grade will be the average of the two marks of the intermediate tests. \nAlternatively, students can take the full exam (based on all contents) at the end of the course. In this case, the exam will be a 90-minute long test that includes a true/false section and two open-ended questions.\nGrades will be scaled as follows:\n<18 fail\n18-23 pass\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\nStudents can reject a passing grade only once. To this end, he/she must email a request to the instructor, who will acknowledge receipt of the message.\nA good background in intermediate macroeconomics is very useful to successfully attend the course.\nTeaching tools\nTeaching material (class notes and further readings) will be available on Moodle platform at:https://virtuale.unibo.it/course/view.php?id=46302\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Giorgio Bellettini"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThis course covers topics on currency, liquidity and balance of payment crises as well as international financial contagion. Issues pertaining to monetary/financial, exchange rate, in connection with the antecedents and aftermath of crises are studied at both the theoretical and empirical level. It is an advanced course that builds on the standard intertemporal small open economy models with frictions such as imperfect capital markets, intertemporal distortions, and non-tradable goods and applies these theoretical tools to study in detail specific topics  inspired by recent events  such as financial crises, the global role of the dollar, and the economic effects of the covid virus.\nCourse contents\nThis course is intended to use simple small open economy models to answer many important macroeconomic questions that arise in emerging markets and developing economies, particularly those regarding monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate issues. We want to think in terms of simple models and grasp the fundamentals of open economy macroeconomics.\nIt is an advanced course that builds on the standard intertemporal small open economy model with frictions such as imperfect capital markets, intertemporal distortions, and non-tradable goods and applies these theoretical tools to a variety of important macroeconomic issues relevant to developing countries (and, in a world of continuing financial crisis, to industrial countries as well), including the relative merits of flexible and predetermined exchange rate regimes. We analyze in detail specific topics such as the “dollarization,” balance of payments crises, and, inspired by recent events, financial crises and the economic effect of the covid virus.\nReadings/Bibliography\nOne book, suggested but not compulsory:\nObstfeld M., K.Rogoff , Foundations of International Economics,1996 MIT Press\n\n+ papers from international scientific journals\nTeaching methods\nFrontal teaching. Theoretical Models will be discussed and developed in class. Particular attention will be devoted to the understanding of model background and empirical implications as well as discussion on policy issues.\nAssessment methods\nFinal written examination. \nThe written exam aims at testing the acquired knowledge of the theoretical concepts and the ability to interpret estimation results in the light of the underlying theory.\n\nThe written exam is closed book and lasts 1 hour and 15 minutes. It is divided in two parts:\n\nTrue , False, Uncertain (answer with concise motivation): 6 questions, 30 points\nOpen question (formal answer to theoretical question): 1 question, 30 points.\n\n\nIn case online exams will be envisaged by the University of Bologna, the structure of the written exam is the same. The exam will be run through Zoom and Exams Online (EOL). Detailed instructions on how to manage and hand in the online exam are available on the course page on the VIRTUALE platform.\nThe maximum possible score is 30 cum laude, in case all anwers are correct, complete and formally rigorous.\nThe grade is graduated as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\n \nTeaching tools\nExercises will be assigned in class but will not be evaluated and considered as part of the final grade.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Laura Bottazzi"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe aim of the course is to introduce students to the laws that govern international transport of goods and financing of trade operations, with a specific focus on documentary credit, and to provide students with a critical knowledge of the issues that operators meet daily. The course has a cross-disciplinary approach, since it will deal with public law, international law and contract law topics. In particular, on the one hand, the transport sector is deeply regulated, at the international, EU and domestic levels; on the other, carriage contracts of goods and documentary credit are relevant examples of the role that international organizations and associations play in setting the parties’ rights and obligations with model contracts and clauses. Through the interactive discussion of leading cases and the exam of standard forms and clauses developed by the relevant international actors, at the end of the course students know the basic principles that govern transports and documentary credit, are able to understand the impact of the international and EU regulation and to apply the knowledge and expertise achieved during the course in real-life contexts, taking into consideration also the other contracts involved in international trade and the legal risks actually faced by operators in different scenarios.\nCourse contents\nThe International Transport and Documentary Credit Law course will provide students with an introduction to the regime of carriage contracts also with a practical approach and to payment methods, in particular documentary credit.\nThe topics will be also addressed paying also attention to the issues related to international sales.\n\nIn particular, the course will cover the following topics, taking into consideration also other (compulsory or optional) teachings provided by the same Course:\n\nThe regulation of transport markets;\nThe provision of transport services and competition issues;\nInternational sales contracts and their interplay with international carriage contracts;\nThe ICC Incoterms® Rules;\nPayment methods in international contracts;\n\nFocus on documentary credit.\n\n\nStudents will benefit from the exam of case studies, to be discussed together during classes, and particular attention will be given to international standard forms and clauses and internationally recognized practices, where the case.\nReadings/Bibliography\nStudents can prepare for the exam on Prof. Orrù’s presentations and the materials uploaded on the course’s website on https://virtuale.unibo.it.\nFurther useful material for preparing the exam or deepening specific topics that could be of interest for the students, could be suggested during the classes also through notices published on the above-mentioned platform, which will be used also for communications addressed to all the students.\nStudents are therefore kindly invited to enroll in the course's website on 'Virtuale'. For this purpose, students have to log in the University website with their own personal institutional credentials and scroll the menu 'Online services' in the header of Unibo home page, above the website logo. The Unibo website provides students with instructions and tutorials for using the 'Virtuale' platform and other useful services.\nThe following books and materials, available at the Unibo libraries and/or as ebooks in the Unibo depository, are suggested for those interested in deepening the topics discussed during the classes, with the recommendation of paying attention that some of them mainly deal with English domestic laws:\n\nMichael Bundock (ed.), Shipping law handbook, 6th edn, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon; New York, Informa Law from Routlegde, 2019,\nGuillermo C. JIMENEZ, ICC guide to export/import. Global standards for international trade, ICC, 5th edn, 2018,\n\nIncoterms 2010, ICC rules for the use of domestic and international trade terms,\n\nIncoterms 2020, ICC rules for the use of domestic and international trade terms,\nInternational Transport Forum, Mode Choice in Freight Transport, Paris, OECD Publishing, 2022,\nVincent Power, EU Shipping Law, 3rd Edn, Informa Law from Routledge, 2019,\nAnthony Rogers, Jason Chuah and Martin Dockray, Cases and materials on the carriage of goods by sea, 5th ed., London-New York, Routledge, 2020,\nSoyer, B.-Tettenborn, A., International Trade and Carriage of Goods, Abingdon-New York, Informa Law from Routlege, 2017,\nUCP 600 and eUCP, version 2.0.\n\nTeaching methods\nThe course is held in English in the first semester, I cycle, and consists of lectures performed with power point presentations with a dynamic approach, aimed at soliciting the discussion among the students and a critical approach to the topics discussed, also through the exam of case-law, standard contracts and clauses and international practices.\nStudents will be involved in the analysis and solution of case studies in order to improve the comprehension of the course's contents and their learning.\nAttention will be paid also to the necessary link of the transport contract to the other different contracts and legal relationships involved.\nThe course participates in the University's teaching innovation project. After some lessons devoted to introduce and discuss a topic, a practical lesson will follow. It will be held in presence or on-line via MS Team platform, depending on the actual number of students and on the specific situation. \nThis lesson will allow the students to test themselves on the topics discussed in the previous lessons with case studies or model contracts. Further materials helpful for participating in this lesson will be uploaded on-line in advance.\nFor this purpose, students will be divided into groups, within which they will autonomously (but under Prof. Orrù's supervision) deal with the specific assignment. In the lesson's final part, the case studies dealt with by the students or the model contracts applied by them will be discussed together.\nWorkshops concerning specific topics and involving the participation of experts could be organized: students will be informed about them during the course and also through notices published on the professor's website.\nAssessment methods\nAssessment methods for students having regularly attended classes:\nStudents having attended at least 50% of classes could benefit from the following assessment method: a short paper on a topic to be agreed together with Prof. Orrù during classes and to be presented during one of the final classes. The paper has to be submitted to Prof. Orrù within the first date scheduled for the exam.\nThe assessment will concern both the presentation (30% of the score) and the paper (70% of the score), in particular the student’s ability to examine the given topic, highlighting the main issues, also through the available bibliographic and case-law resources, provided that in order to pass the exam a sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the topics discussed in the presentation and in the paper and adequate language skills are needed. The assessment will be, in particular based on the following criteria:\n- basic analysis of the subject-matter and the issues there implied, without the capacity of autonomously identifying and deepening all of them; an acceptable, but very short blbliography; basic yet appropriate language: 18-19/30;\n- ability to identify the main issues involved in the subject-matter; ability to autonomously address their analysis, still developed at a rather basic level; quite well developed bibliography; use of appropriate language: 20-24/30;\n- comprehensive analysis of the subject-matter, based on an appropriate bibliography; ability to autonomously identify and critically analyse the issues involved in the subject-matter, use of specific terminology: 25-29/30;\n- extensive analysis of the subject-matter, based on a very accurate bibliograhy; ability to reason autonomously and critically identify and analyse the related issues, make connections between the topics, also with regard to the other content examined during the classes, ability to master the specific terminology and ability to present the arguments: 30-30 Hons/30.\nThe score will be out of 30/30, with honours for the best students. The minimum score for passing the exam is 18/30. The student can refuse the mark, but s/he will have to sit for the normal exam (see the para. below).\n\nAssessment method for students that did not regularly attend classes:\nThe other students will be assessed by a 45-minute multiple-choice exam. The exam will consist of 31 questions, based on Prof. Orrù’s presentations and materials that will be uploaded on the 'Virtuale' platform and recommended on its forum. Each question will have 3 possible answers, only one of which is correct. Each right answer will give one point, so that it will be possible to get the maximum score of 30 with honours, whereas each wrong answer will give no penalty. The score will be out of 30/30, with honours for the best students. The minimum score for passing the exam is therefore 18/30.\nDuring the exam the use of aids, such as textbooks, notes, computer devices, is not allowed.\nTeaching tools\nPower point presentations and teaching materials, which will be uploaded on the 'Virtuale' platform, multimedia tools for interactive and dynamic teaching, books and papers meant to deepen some topics of the course.\nFurther technological materials, deemed useful to teaching purposes, could be used.\nDisabled Students or with specific learning disabilities (SLD) needing compensatory tools, may inform the professors about their needs in order to be addressed to the School’s specific Services and agree on suitable measures.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Elena Orrù"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe goal of this course is to introduce students to the vast field of behavioral economics, an interdisciplinary area that employs the employs concepts from economics and psychology to gain a deeper understanding of individual behavior. The theory has important applications to finance, the organization of human resources and the labor market, consumer behavior, marketing, health, and the associated public policies.\nCourse contents\nRequirements:\nThe course relies on basic notions of microeconomics and game theory, and makes use of simple algebra and calculus.\nMAIN TOPICS\nPart 1: Individual decisions\nChoice under risk and uncertainty.\nIn this set of classes, we will focus on individual decision making when the payoff outcomes cannot be known for sure in advance. After having reviewed the basic concepts of Expected Utility Theory, we will discuss some “anomalies” in lottery-choice situations, and other observed departures from the theoretically optimal behaviour, and we will discuss Prospect Theory as an alternative model of choice under risk and uncertainty.\nInformation and learning\nInformation specific to individuals is often unobserved by others. Such information may be conveyed at a cost, but misrepresentation and strategic non-revelation is sometimes a problem. Informational asymmetries yield rich economic models that may have multiple equilibria and unusual patterns of behavior. Here we will consider how information is used to form and update beliefs (Bayesian updating and behavioral models of learning). Finally we will study situations in which people may learn from others’ actions, giving rise to bandwagon effects.\nPart 2: Behavioral Game Theory\nThis part presents several games in which behavior is influenced by intuitive economic forces in ways that are not captured by basic game theory. We will consider models that try to account for these empirical regularities, by relaxing the strong game-theoretic assumptions of perfect rationality and perfect predictions of others’ decisions.\nPart 3: Social preferences\nBilateral bargaining\nThis part focuses on the issues of fairness, equity, trust and reciprocity within the framework of bilateral bargaining. We will review the vast experimental literature on these issues, which highlight how – under several circumstances – observed behavior tends to depart in substantial ways from the standard theoretical predictions.\nPublic choice\nThis part focuses on situations in which the outcome, and the social welfare, depends on the behavior of a large set of agents. We will study situations where the actions taken by some people affect the well being of others. Examples are the provision of public goods, and the exploitation of common resources.\nPart 4: Behavioral macroeconomics and behavioral finance\nBehavioral macroeconomics\nThis part covers studies that are motivated by macro issues of consumption, banking, and multi-market production, in the attempt to provide some insights in the understanding of banking and macroeconomics crises.\nBehavioral finance\nThis part reviews the main insights from the field of Behavioral finance, which approaches the study of financial phenomena through the lenses of models that do not rely on the assumption of agents' full rationality. We will explore the main types of deviations form full rationality that have been shown to impact on financial markets, the emergence of financial bubbles, and the literature on the \"limits to arbitrage,\" which discusses the consequences that these departures from the rationality paradigm may have on the equilibrium outcomes.\nReadings/Bibliography\nMain references:\nHolt, Charles A.

National Bureau of Economic Research. https://www.nber.org/papers/w24723\nThe lecture notes will be updated the day before each class on the course’s e-learning platform: https://virtuale.unibo.it/course/view.php?id=40236.\nTeaching methods\nTeaching will combine participation in mock-experiments, active on-line learning exercises, and traditional lecturing. Attending classes is not compulsory but highly recommended, as participation in the classroom experiments and discussions is meant to help students’ understanding of the topics of the course.\nAssessment methods\nThe final exam aims at verifying the acquisition of the following learning outcomes:\n— basic knowledge of the methodology of experimental economics;\n— understanding of the main differences between the predictions of the standard neoclassical model and the alternative predictions of behavioral models.\n— ability to apply behavioral models to interpret and predict behavior in simple frameworks.\nStudents will be assessed based on their performance in a written and oral final exam, which will include a set of questions covering both the mathematical/analytical aspects of the models discussed in class and their interpretation. The first part of the exam will be held in the computer lab. Questions will be randomly extracted from a predefined set, so the exam content will be different for each student. The first part of the exam will contain multiple-choice questions and exercises with numerical answers. The second part of the exam is oral and includes open questions. Students will access the second part of the exam only if they pass the first part—which is automatically graded by the software.\nIn case online exams will be envisaged by the University of Bologna, the structure of the written exam is the same. The exam will be run through Zoom and Exams Online (EOL). Detailed instructions on how to manage and hand in the online exam are available on the course page on the VIRTUALE platform.\nIn the written part of the final exam, students may use calculators (but not other electronic devices), but they may not communicate with others, consult notes, books, or other written material. Any attempt to violate these rules will result in the student's exclusion from the exam.\nThe written part of the final exam lasts one hour. Students also have the option of taking two midterm exams. The structure of the full exam is simply the sum of the content of the two midterms.\nThe dates of the final exams are fixed and cannot be changed. Requests for additional dates will not be accepted.\nThe maximum grade in the final exam is 30 cum laude – and this also holds for the two midterm exams. In case the student takes the midterm exams, the final grade is given by the average of the grades obtained in the first and in the second midterm.\nThe grade is graduated as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 cum laude - excellent\nGrade rejection: students can reject the grade obtained at the exam only once. To this end, they must email a request to the instructor within the date set for registration. The instructor will confirm reception of the request within the same date.\nRejection is intended with respect to the whole exam, whose grade is the average of the grades obtained in the two midterms. If the grade is rejected, the student must retake the full exam (consisting of both parts). The only grade that can be rejected without any communication from the student is the one of the first midterm: in this case, the student can either take the second midterm or sit the full exam (thus losing the grade obtained in the first midterm).\nStudents sitting the first midterm can take the second midterm on the first examination date set for the full exam, right at the end of the integrated course, or on the following call. A student can sit the second midterm only once; if he/she fails or rejects the grade obtained, he/she will have to resit the full exam and will lose the grade obtained in the first midterm.\nThe bonus points from the presentation can be used again after the grade rejection, but are only valid in case the student passes the exam by February.\nTeaching tools\nDuring the course, students will be involved in mock experiments, which should provide them with a more vivid idea of the issues to be examined later during the lecture, and active participation to the in-class discussion will be encouraged.\nAttending the classes is not compulsory, but highly recommended.\nStudents will also be requested to constantly test their understanding of the basic concepts discussed in class by means of quizzes that will be published on the on-line e-learning platform (IOL) at the end of each week. Quizzes are not compulsory, can be retaken as many times as students wish, and will not be corrected. The tutor of the course will be available one hour per week to answer questions on the quizzes.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Maria Bigoni"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nIn this course we will analyze how the labor market works, how agents in this special market behave, and how governments regulate and set up institutions to govern the labor market. Whether and how much to work, how much to invest in human capital (skills), unionization, and whether and where to migrate are all examples of decisions on the supply side of the labor market. The combination of labor (or different types of labor) and other factors in production, and job creation and job destruction are examples of decisions on the demand side of the labor market. Minimum wages, unemployment insurance, employment protection legislation, and collective bargaining, are examples of institutions governing the labor market. At the end of the course students will be able to understand the literature and participate in a non-ideological way to the debate about labor issues.\nCourse contents\nThis is an undergraduate-level, introductory course in labor economics. The goal is to introduce students to labor market measurement and to the theoretical and empirical analysis of the labor market and labor market policy. The course consists of two modules:\n \nModule 1 (Giulio Zanella, 30 hours):\n- Labor market measurement and statistics\n- Labor supply and demand\n- Labor market equilibrium\n- Policy applications\n \nModule 2 (Diego Lanzi, 15 hours):\n- Labor market institutions\n- Collective bargaining\n- Human Capital and education\n- Active Labor market policies\nReadings/Bibliography\nModule 1 (Giulio Zanella, 30 hours):\n\nMeasuring the Economy (Edited by Jonathan Athow and Joe Grice), free online textbook\n\nLabor Economics (George J. Borjas), Harvard University - Cambridge\n\n\n \nModule 2 (Diego Lanzi, 15 hours):\n\nBoeri T., van Ours J. (2008) \"The Economics of Imperfect Labor Markets\", Princeton University Press\n\nTeaching methods\nLectures will illustrate theory and empirical applications, and will guide students to independent study and critical thinking.\nDuring classes and tutorials, problems from the textbook and past exam will be solved. These exercises give students an idea of what to expect at the exam.\nAssessment methods\nWritten final exam (90 minutes) consisting of a mix of problem solving, short essay questions, and multiple choice questions. These questions are both theoretical and applied.\nThe maximum possible grade is 30 cum laude.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course student has knowledge of a detailed analysis of the main areas in labor economics, both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective. Topics include the analysis of labor supply by individual and households, labor demand by firms, equilibrium wage differentials and employment outcomes resulting from the interaction of such supply and demand, education and human capital, life-cycle profiles, job search models, and labor market institutions. At the end of the course student has an understanding of how labor markets work and possess the basic tools to undertake original research in the field.\nCourse contents\nThis is a graduate-level (Master and PhD), research-oriented course in labor economics. The goal is to introduce students to advanced analysis of labor markets and to provide them with tools to engage in independent research in labor economics. We will cover the following topics:\n- The methodology of advanced labor economics\n- Labor supply and demand\n- Search and matching (with applications to active labor market policy and minimum wages)\n- The Roy model (with applications to immigration and education policy)\nReadings/Bibliography\n- Lecture notes.\n- Labor Economics, Second Edition, by Pierre Cahuc, Stéphane Carcillo and André Zylberberg, MIT Press, 2014 (a useful, though not required, graduate-level textbook).\n- Research articles assigned during the semester.\nTeaching methods\nLectures will illustrate theory and empirical applications, and will guide students to independent study and critical thinking.\nAssessment methods\nProblem sets will be assigned during the semester. The final exam consists of a report and presentation of a research article related to the topics studied in class, chosen from a list prepared by the instructor. The final grade is computed as follows: problem sets 30%; final exam 70%. The maximum possible grade is 30 cum laude.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThis is a graduate-level course in growth economics and long term development. The course presents a detailed analysis of the state of the art research on long run growth in both a time series and a cross-country perspective. Topics include theoretical and empirical analysis of the fundamental determinants of economic growth from a multi-disciplinary perspective. The course focuses attention, in particular, on the role of economic and political institutions, geography and demography. By the end of the course the student will acquire theoretical and empirical tools that allow him/her to get a deep understanding of the recent literature, to build his/her own critical views, and to start undertaking original research in the field.\nCourse contents\nThe course is organized into two conceptual blocks. The first part introduces the main facts of long-run cross country development in multiple dimensions. These include in particular economic, demographic, and political development. As a first step, we present the theoretical fundamentals and existing arguments put forwards to study these dynamics in the different domains ant their interactions. We discuss existing evidence starting from reduced form empirical evidence derived from cross country panel data. We then push the view towards the state of the art recent research that aims at understanding the evolution of comparative development in history with the use of disaggregated historical data and multiple methods including also quantitative and structural estimation analysis.\nDuring the course we will present research articles that will be selected on topics also accounting for the specific interests of enrolled students. \nUnderstanding of basic theory (for instance game theory, growth theory), panel data econometrics and causal inference is required.\n \n \nReadings/Bibliography\nA baseline list of papers will be circulated at the beginning of the course. Further paper selected by topics will be chosen during the course also depending on the interests of students.\nTeaching methods\nClasses and reading of papers and Discussion in Class.\nAssessment methods\nThe exam will involve studying and replicating a published paper and presenting a paper in a final \"students' workshop\". Depending on the number of students enrolled also a mid-term (possibly take-home) exam may be organized.\nTeaching tools\nClasses with presentations and blackboard. Slides of lectures will be made available. Students are expected to read and discuss papers published in top journals with both theoretical and empirical content.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Matteo Cervellati"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course students know issues and method of Macroeconomics. Students learn to understand Macroeconomic equilibrium in protected and open economic systems and the main issues of public policy debate in Economics.\nCourse contents\nThe program covers chapters 1-21 of Mankiw's handbook (11th edition, see below) and in particular the following topics.\nIntroduction\nIntroduction to Macroeconomics\nData and models \nGDP\nClassic theory: the economy in the long run\nThe long run\nIncome production, distribution and expenditure\nEquilibrium in the goods market and in the financial market\nThe monetary system\nInflation\nCosts of inflation\nOpen economy: trade balance and net capital outflows\nOpen economy: real and nominal exchange rate\nUnemployment\nLabor market reforms in Europe and in Italy\nGrowth theory: the economy in the very long run\nEconomic growth and the Solow model: capital accumulation, steady state, policy, golden rule, population dynamics, technological progress, empirics, growth enhancing policies\nEndogenous growth\nBusiness cycle theory: the economy in the short run\nIntroduction to short run fluctuations: AD-SRAS-LRAS IS-LM model\nEconomic policy, shocks, IS-LM and AD\nGreat depression, Japanese stagnation, Great recession, European sovereign debt crisis, Covid-19 pandemics\nFiscal and monetary policy in the EU since the Great recession\nMundell- Fleming model\nInternational financial crises\nAggregate supply and Phillips curve \nAdaptive and rational expectations\nThe debate on macroeconomic policy\nStabilization policy\nDebt and deficit\nFinancial system: opportunities and dangers \nReadings/Bibliography\nN. Gregory Mankiw, Macroeconomics, 12th Edition, Macmillan, 2025\nFor some arguments we will also refer to CORE Econ, The Econmy (1.0 and 2.0)\nTeaching methods\nLectures, tutorials, and home assignments for attending students\nAssessment methods\nMandatory written exam (computerized): 30 points available. It consists of 9 multiple choice questions (2 points each) and 4 open questions (3 points each).\nOptional oral exam: +/- 3 points from the grade of the written exam (mandatory to obtain \"30/30 cum laude\"). The oral exam consists of 3 questions on the entire program, whose answers may increase or decrease the grade by one point each.\nThe oral exam can be taken only at the first session following the written exam. Admission to the oral exam requires a grade of at least 15/30 in the written exam.\nPartial exams: for attending students there will be a partial exam after the first half of the course (on the program of chapters 1-7); the second partial exam (on the remaining program) can be sustained either at the end of the course (the day of the first full exam) or at the following session (the day of the second full exam), but it can be sustained only once. The final grade, which can be recorded or modified through the optional oral exam, will be the simple average of the two partial exams. Even for those opting for partial exams, the optional oral exam covers the entire program.\nIn both written and oral exams the evaluation depends on the correctness, completeness and rigor of the answers.\nRegistration on AlmaEsami is mandatory both for written exam sessions and for the \"Oral and grade recording\" session immediately following the completion of the written exam. Those who show up at this session will be able to review the corrections and choose whether to give the oral exam or not. Those who do not show up will have the grade of the written exam recorded. \nOFA: students with OFA in Math cannot sustain either total or partial exams.\nErasmus: at most 20 Erasmus and Overseas students, and 10 UADE students, selected in chronological order, will be admitted to the course and the exam.\n\nHome assignements: for those attending the course and taking partial exams, there will be bi-weekly home assignements. Handing in all assignements raises the grade of each partial exam by 1 point. \nFractionary final grades obtained in the written exam will be approximated to the superior unit above 0.5 included, and to the inferior unit otherwise.\nThe (rounded) final grade  can be refused only once.\nGrading scale:\n< 18: failed\n18-23: sufficient\n24-27: good\n28-30: very good\n30 e lode: outstanding\n\nTeaching tools\nSlides published online in advance.\nStudents with disability or specific learning disabilities (DSA) are required to make their condition known to find the best possibile accommodation to their needs.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Paolo Vanin"

The student will also master the main issues of the impact of the macroeconomy on financial markets and vice versa.  In particular he will be required to have adequate knowledge of the main techniques of risk measurement at the macroeconomic level, articulated in terms of systemic risk and contagion, in the relationship among sovereign entities, the financial sector and the real economy.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course students are able to understand and use the main variable, theories and tools of marketing managemant. After discussing some main theoretical frameworks at hte end of the course students will be able to aplly them to the real company and market contest. Students are able to analyse behavior and after sale behavior of costumers, to segment the market, to define a marketing plan and decide the main section of marketing mix such as product and brand management, pricing, distribution channels and comunication.\nCourse contents\nThe course is designed to provide a broad understanding of marketing and the role of marketing in the society, from the basics to the most recent advancements of the discipline. It drives students to understand the basic principles and theories of marketing and it aims to offer students models and tools to manage the exchange process between firms and customers.\nThe course is structured in two main modules:\n\nThe first part of the course is dedicated to the diagnostic nature of marketing activity, with the aim to familiarize students with the fundamentals of marketing research, that is developing research questions, analyzing data and drawing inferences, with a view to making better business decisions. Here, the course is a walk through the main strategic decisions falling under the marketing domain: analyzing consumer needs, developing segmentation and targeting positioning, developing marketing strategies and plans. \nThe second part of the course is focused on the implementation side of the marketing, where main strategic policies are concretely realized and oriented to the market: students will discuss how a product can be launched and managed and how a marketing strategy can be implemented through distribution decisions, sales force management, pricing decisions, communication decisions. A specific focus will be dedicated to the emerging role of \"marketing as a force for good\" in line with the most recent advancements of the discipline and practice. \n\nThe course is held during the months of September-December\n \nReadings/Bibliography\nThe required textbook is: \nTitle: Marketing Management, \nAuthors: Russ Winer, Ravi Dhar\nPublisher: Prentice Hall (International Edition) Fourth Edition\nYear: 2014 \nLecture notes\nStudents will be equipped with slides and additional material during the course that will be uploaded on Virtuale in .pdf format before each class, so that students can bring a printed version of the slides to annotate them during class at their convenience. \nTeaching methods\nEach class is either primarily a lecture or a case analysis and discussion. Exercises and teamwork will be also developed to open discussion about how to analyze read data and apply the concepts to real cases. \nGuest speakers will be invited to bring also a practical perspective to the course.\nWe will learn that marketing is an evolving discipline so lectures will be continously filled with real examples from the practice. Students will also be asked to bring their own examples in class by observing what is happening during their daily life (at the supermarket, on social media platforms, by watching TV or by reading the newspaper). \nParticipation of Exchange Students:\n\nA maximum of 20 exchange students (Erasmus, Overseas, etc.) is accepted. FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED logic will be used for incoming students.\nAssessment methods\nThough not compulsory, class attendance and participation in team-work assignments is strongly encouraged. Team-work assignments consist of:\na) One intermediate short team-work project at the end of the first term\nb) One final team-work project at the end of the second term\nDetails about the topic of the team-work projects will be presented during lectures. \nCourse evaluation will be different depending on the participation in team-work assignment, as detailed in the following:\nStudents participating in team-work assignments:\n50% final written exam\n50% team-work assignment\nStudents who do not participate in team-work assignments:\n100% final written exam\n \nThe evaluation criteria for the project work are the following:\n- Exhaustivity of the presentation\n- Ability to address the topic correctly\n- Presentation skills\n- Respect of the allotted time\nFinal written exam\nStudents can attend a mid-term exam (not compulsory) during the teaching break at the end of the first sub-cycle, and then the second mid-term exam at the end of the course. The grades of the two mid-term exams will be averaged to compute the “final written exam” grade.\nBy School regulation, those who positively pass the first mid-term exam (i.e. grade greater or equal to 18), have the chance to take the second mid-term exam either in the January or February session. However, the second mid-term can be taken only once. Therefore, if a student does not pass the second mid-term exam (or opts for a re-take), s/he can attend only total exams from that moment on.\nThe course material chapters on the topics discussed in the team-work assignments will be excluded from the exam program for those students who will participate in team-work assignments.\nThe evaluation criteria for the final exam are the following:\n- Ability to answer correctly the questions\n- Quality of response/length of the response ratio\nGrading\nThe test assessment grid is determined as follows:\n- < 18 insufficient\n- 18-23 sufficient\n- 24-27 average/good\n- 28-30 very good\n- 30 cum laude excellent/outstanding\nTeaching tools\nTeaching materials essential to the course and compulsory for the exams is available thorough \"Teaching resources on Virtuale\".\nStudents with disability or specific learning disabilities (DSA) are required to make their condition known to find the best possibile accomodation to their needs\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Annamaria Tuan"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course introduces students to the fundamental topics of microeconomics: theory of consumption, theory of production, competitive markets, monopoly, imperfect competition, and the role of the government. The goal is to acquire a working knowledge of how consumers, producers, and the government interact in a market economy. At the end of the course, students will be able to analyze the economic choices of individual actors and their desirability at the individual and collective level.\nCourse contents\nTo introduce economic concepts we will rely on the language of mathematics and on graphs. A knowledge of calculus is necessary to fully understand lectures and reading material.\n \n** note for Erasmus and exchange students **\nWe use calculus to teach this class. I strongly recommend students who have not taken a mathematics class to select other classes.\n\n \nThis class will be taught in the SECOND semester in the Bologna campus. The plan is to cover these topics: \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Introduction\n2. Competitive markets\n3. Consumer choice\n4. Production\n5. Climate change\n6. Monopoly\n7. Imperfect competition\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n8. Uncertainty\n9. The State as an economic actor\n10. Markets and taxation\n11. Economic Inequality\n12. Labor markets\n13. Credit markets\n14.

These activities are integral part of your learning experience. Students are expected to attend lectures and complete the mandatory readings. Readings are a complement to, not a substitute for, lectures---the exam will test knowledge of both.\nAttending lectures is recommended because the concepts covered in class only partially overlaps with the textbook and because it is the only way to experience the in-class games. Lectures will include a variety of in-class games, where you will take decisions in economic situations and which constitute a critical learning experience.\nIn addition to lectures, there will be recitations to go through practice problems and applications. You will be assigned to a group and will have the opportunity to earn extra points in each recitation session. These points will be added to your midterm or your final exam score.\n            \n            \n                Assessment methods\nThe course grade will be determined by a midterm exam and a final exam. See the general rules here: https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/EconomicsPoliticsSocialSciences/information-and-rules-about-exams \nBoth exams will be written, and will contain a mixture of multiple choice and short open questions, including practical exercises. The midterm will account for 50% of your grade, and the final exam will account for the remaining 50%.\nThe midterm will cover topics 1-7.\nThe final will cover topics 8-14. If you pass the midterm, then you can take the final. If you fail the midterm, then you will have to take the full exam. If you pass the midterm and fail the final, then you will have to take the full exam. \nThe full exam will cover topics 1-14. \nFor EPOS students, passing the Microeconomics exam by September is a pre-requisite in order to be able to take the midterm and the final exam of other courses.

Specifically, students will be able to analyze the determinants of demand and supply functions in two commodity models, to compute and analyze equilibria in simple partial and general equilibrium settings.\nCourse contents\nTopics addressed should include:\n\n1. Introduction to the market and the concept of economic rationality\n\n2. Consumer Theory\n- The budget\n- Preferences and Utility\n- Choice\n- Individual demand (for goods and services)\n- Labour supply\n\n3. Market equilibrium\n- Market demand\n- Market equilibrium and the implications of taxes on consumption\n\n4. Producer Theory\n- Technology\n- Profit maximisation\n- Cost minimisation\n- Firm supply in a competitive market\n- Industry supply in a competitive market\n- The implications for supply of non-competitive market structures: Monopoly and Oligopoly\n\n5. The concepts of Externalities and Public Goods may also be introduced.\n \nThe first partial (mid-term) exam will cover topics 1., 2., and 3., while the second partial exam will cover topics 4., and 5.\nFull exams can cover material from any of the five topics.\n            \n            \n                Readings/Bibliography\nThe text book for the course will be:\nVarian, Hal R., Intermediate Microeconomics: A Modern Approach, (9th international student edition, or 10th international student edition by Varian and Melitz), published by WW Norton & Co.\nIt is strongly recommended that students have access to a copy of the textbook. \nNote that there is also a version of the textbook \"with calculus\"; this version is fine too.\nThere is also an accompanying exercise book which students may find useful (though it is not required reading). This exercise book is:\nBergstrom, Theodore C. and Hal R. Varian, Workouts in Intermediate Microeconomics for Intermediate Microeconomics and Intermediate Microeconomics with Calculus, 2014, W.W. Norton & Co.: New York, London\n\n\nCopies of teaching materials (slides, exercises) will be published on the university, virtuale. \nTeaching methods\nTraditional lectures led by the course lecturer.\nLessons to work through exercises led by course lecturer or tutor.\nAssessment methods\nFinal written exam of about one and a half or two hours.\nMid term exam(s)/tests FOR CURRENT (1st year) STUDENTS ONLY (students from earlier years must take the full exams).\nFor students taking the mid-term exams, the final mark for the course will be an average of the marks in the two \"partial\" exams. Only students with a sufficiently high mark in the first mid-term exam will be admitted to the second partial: other candidates must proceed to the full exams.\n\nDuring exams (mid-term or full exams) students will NOT be allowed to use materials such as: textbooks, lecture notes/slides; any written notes; web-enabled or data storage devices such as computers (laptops or tablets), or smartphones. Candidates found with such items will be subject to disciplinary proceedings.\n\nThe exams will contain a mixture of multiple choice (and possibly \"fill in the blanks\") questions, and computational/open exercises. The division of marks between the different types of question will be indicated on exam papers where this is appropriate.\nThe content and structure of exam questions is intended to assess familiarity with the material covered in the course lectures, and, in particular, to assess understanding of the theoretical content of the course. The nature of exam questions will closely follow examples covered as exercises during the course, and discussed in lectures/tutorials.\nExams will be administered in person. Only in an emergency situation (e.g. a return of the recent health emergency) may if be necessary to administer exams “online” for some or all students. This will not affect the structure of the written exam. However, written exams taken \"online\" may need to be supplemented with an oral exam. Online written exams would be administered using a combination of two software packages: most likely ZOOM and EOL (esami online). \n\nCandidates will be required to enroll for exams via the University's electronic service (currently AlmaEsami). Exam marks will be published via the University's electronic service (AlmaEsami). The mark published after a second partial exam or after a full exam will be the student’s final mark for the course.\nAfter exams students will be entitled to see their script by attending the lecturer’s office hour.\nStudents will be allowed to reject their final grade for the course exactly ONCE. When exam results are published, the date by which students must notify the course lecturer of their intention to reject their mark, will be communicated to candidates. Notification of the intention to reject must be sent in writing (by email). After the date specified, marks will be electronically registered (verbalizzato).\nFinal grades for the course will be out of 30. A grade of at least 18 is required to pass the course, and the maximum is 30 with distinction (“30 e lode”). As a guide, the grade scale (for “pass” grades) can be thought of as follows:\n- 18 – 22: Adequate\n- 23 – 25: Good\n- 26 – 27: Very good\n- 28 – 30: Excellent\n- 30 e lode: Outstanding\nTeaching tools\nSlides\nExample exercises\nStudents with a disability or specific learning disabilities (DSA) are required to make their condition known in order that the best possible accommodation to their needs may be found.\n\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Matthew John Wakefield"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course students with understands of the principles of micro-economic analysis. They have been introduced the concept of economic rationality as it applies to individuals and firms, and the analysis of how price and quantity are set under different market structures. Moreover students are introduced to topics addressed in more detail will include the form of utility and production functions, and rational decision making and intertemporal choice in the face of uncertainty. Implications for the behaviour and organization of firms will be highlighted throughout.\nCourse contents\nCourse contents\nNote 1: the course is in English\nNote 2: the content of this course differs drastically from previous years. The material on the exam in September 2024 will reflect previous year course materials. After the September 2024 exam, all future exams will be based on the new course content.\nUnit 1: Prosperity, inequality and planetary limits\nWe take a broad view of economics to understand its role in shaping our current global environment.\nUnit 2: Technology and Incentives\nWe will develop the building blocks of production, which is the main activity of the firm and study the role of technological innovation in driving economic growth. This will form the basis of the “supply” side of the market.\nUnit 3: Scarcity, wellbeing and working hours\nWe will develop the building blocks of individual decision-making and how individuals make trade-offs between consumption and leisure. This will build the basis of the “demand” side of the market.\nUnit 4: Strategic interactions and social dilemmas\nWe will introduce concepts from “game theory” to understand how individuals interact and study the emergence and resolution of various social dilemmas.\nUnit 5: The rules of the game: what gets what and why\nWe will study how institutions, which form the “rules” of an economic system, shape economic outcomes. We will discuss issues of fairness and efficiency.\nUnit 6: The firm and its employees\nWe will study the structure of the firm and the interaction of firms and employees. \nUnit 7: The firm and its customers\nWe will study how the firm interacts with customers and how the structure of the market affects the relationship between firms and customers. We will introduce ideas of profit maximization, perfect competition and monopoly. \nUnit 8: Supply and demand: markets with many buyers and sellers\nWe will bring together the supply and demand side of the markets to understand how markets work in a competitive equilibrium. We will also discuss the shortcomings of studying markets using the assumptions of perfect competition.\nUnit 9: Skip\nUnit 10: Market successes and failures\nWe will delve more deeply into the notion that markets are not always perfectly competitive and study what happens when there is a market failure.\nThe first mid-term exam will units 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5; the second mid-term exam will cover units 6, 7, 8, and 10.\nFull exams can cover material from any of the nine units.\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe textbook for the course will be:\nThe CORE Econ Team 2023 The Economy 2.0: Microeconomics Open access e-text https://core-econ.org/the-economy/ .\nYou can access the textbook for free here: https://core-econ.org/the-economy/\nIt is strongly recommended that students make use of the textbook.\nTeaching materials (e.g., slides, notes, exercises) will be published on the university platform VIRTUALE: https://virtuale.unibo.it/\n\nTeaching methods\nTraditional lectures led by the course lecturers.\nLessons to work through exercises led by course lecturers or tutor.\nAssessment methods\nFinal written exam of about one and a half or two hours, or two mid-term exams of about one and a half or two hours each.\nThe content and structure of the exam questions is intended to assess familiarity with the material covered in the course lectures and to assess understanding of the theoretical content of the course. The nature of the exam questions will closely follow examples covered as exercises during the course and discussed in lectures/tutorials.\nBoth mid-term and full exam will be based on multiple-choice questions aimed at assessing students’ ability to solve exercises and their understanding of the theoretical content of the course.\nDuring exams students will NOT be allowed to use anything but a pen, pencil, and eraser. That is, students will NOT be allowed to bring materials such as: textbooks, lecture notes/slides; any written notes; web-enabled or data storage devices, or smartphones. Candidates found with such items will be removed from the exam and their work will not be graded.\nNote: Only students with a sufficiently high grade in the first mid-term exam (i.e., 18 or higher) will be admitted to the second one: other candidates must proceed to the full exams.\n\nFor students taking the mid-term exams (esami parziali), the final grade for the course will be the arithmetic average of the grades in the two mid-term exams (with 30 cum laude on a given mid-term counting as 31).\nFor students taking the full exam, the grade of the exam is the final grade.\n\nThere will be only one opportunity to take the first mid-term, in October. The second mid-term can instead be taken EITHER in December OR in January, on the same dates of the full exam. That is, if a student takes the second mid-term in December, she cannot take the second mid-term again in January; instead, she will have to take the full exam (in January or in September).\nThe exam grading system is on a 0-30 scale. The maximum possible score is 30 cum laude, in case all answers are correct, complete, and formally rigorous. If that is not the case, the following grading scheme applies:\n<18 fail\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 cum laude: excellent\nTo take the exam, candidates are required to register via the University’s electronic service (AlmaEsami). Students who fail to register for an exam on AlmaEsami will NOT be allowed to take the exam. Exam grades will be published via the University's electronic service (EOL).\nAfter exams are graded, students will have the chance to see their graded exam on a date/time/location determined by the lecturers and communicated (via VIRTUALE) to the students.\nStudents will be allowed to reject their final grade for the course at most ONCE. Upon publishing the exam results, the lecturers will inform students about the deadline to reject their grade. Notification of the intention to reject a grade must be sent in writing (by email). After the date specified, grades will be electronically registered (verbalizzato).\nTeaching tools\nSlides and sample exercises will be available on the platform VIRTUALE: https://virtuale.unibo.it/\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Stephanie Heger"

Tacticts to handle conflict in organizations\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe handbook of the course is: Jennifer M. George and Gareth R. Jones. (2014). Understanding and Managing Organizational Behavior. London: Pearson Education.\n· Case studies, literature (book chapters and international papers), and further material available on the Internet will be provided on the website on virtuale.unibo.it, handed over or suggested during class activities.\nThe project is based on a Harvard Business case study indicated at the beginning of class activities.\nAdditional References for the Overall Course\n§ Kayes, A., Kayes, D. C., Elsbach, K.D. (2016). Contemporary Organizational Behavior: From Ideas to Action. India: Pearson.\nRobbins, S. P., Judge, T. A. (2017). Essentials of Organizational Behavior, Global Edition. London: Pearson.\nTeaching methods\nThe course will consist of interactive lessons, discussion of case studies and media material, and group activities. Specifically, the course conveys organizational behavior models and practices aimed at: a) grasping and applying basic organizational behavior constructs; b) developing critical thinking to drive organizational decision making processes; c) detecting appropriate approaches to organizational problem solving.\nAdditionally, this course intends to develop and practice teamwork skills by examining complex situations, identifying common action plans, and coming up with solution during projects. In order to do so, work groups will be set up.\nAssessment methods\nThe final exam of the overall course consists of two parts for both attending and non-attending students:\na) Group project based on a Harvard Business School case study\nb) Individual test based on two or three open questions\nThe final grade will be calculated as follows:\n- 50% stemming from the group project evaluation (the same for all members of a given group)\n- 50% stemming from the individual test evaluation\nThere will be minimum 3 and maximum 5 members for each group. Students will form groups on their own with the only aim of guaranteeing heterogeneity in terms of individual characteristics. The project will concern the application of themes and tools learned during the course to the analysis and the identification of problems and subsequent elaboration of solutions for a case study or a movie assigned by the instructor.\nAll groups will have to submit a final Powerpoint or Prezi report of the case study work, including multimedia contents, by Wednesday Apri 30, 2025. The Powerpoint or Prezi report has to be uploaded on the specific OneDrive folder.\nThe main criteria for assessing the group work will be: quality of the project; analysis capabilities; problem identification and problem-solving capabilities. Each criterion has the same weight, 10/30.\nThe final grade will be calculated based on 50% of the individual test grade and 50% of the group project grade. Algebraic approximation will be applied: grades up to 0.49 will be rounded down to the lower integer number, whereas grades higher than 0.50 will be rounded up to the upper integer number.\nStudents who will get at least 27/30 grade in both the individual test and the group project, will be rewarded with an extra 3% (before approximation).\nRegistering dates and all information about the course will be communicated only via Virtuale (virtuale.unibo.it).

Special emphasis will be on understanding democratic backsliding, illiberalism, and populism, with case studies from around the world. Students will engage with theoretical frameworks and empirical studies to critically analyze current political phenomena and their implications for democratic governance.\nPlease note that not all topics covered in the assigned readings will be dealt with in class, and some of the topics dealt with in class are not covered in the assigned readings.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe goal of this course is to discuss current topics in political economics. Thus, the course will address questions such as: what are the political and institutional determinants of fiscal policy and macroeconomic policy in modern democracies? Which features of political institutions are more likely to foster economic development?\nAt the end of the class student has knowledge on using the concepts and tools of the new political economy to analyze current topics in this field. Student is able to analyze issues such as: - the interaction between politics and economics in shaping macroeconomic policies in modern democracies; - the role of political institutions in the process of economic growth and development. The course is meant to train students to understand how policy decisions are made, and how they can be improved.\nCourse contents\nErasmus students: Please note that you cannot take this course if you have not yet taken a course in Microeconomics (a formal requirement at EPOS) AND a course in econometrics (a de facto requirement given the content of the course).\nNote that this syllabus may be subject to changes; thus, please make sure you are checking the most updated version of the syllabus.\nThis version was last changed on July 2, 2024.\n\n\nTopic 1: Introduction\nCorrelation vs. causation, omitted variable bias, institutions and socio-economic performance\nTopic 2: Externalities\nThe first fundamental theorem of welfare economics, externalities, climate change\nTopic 3: Aggregating individual preferences\nThe Condorcet paradox, Arrow’s impossibility theorem, restrictions on preferences, the median voter theorem, Downsian competition, the Meltzer-Richard’s model\nTopic 4: Social capital\nWhat is social capital? Why does it matter? What is the relationship between mass media and social capital?\n-- First midterm --\nTopic 5: Discrimination and inequality\nStatistical and taste-based discrimination, with applications to schooling and cricket\nTopic 6: Structural change\nLabor, automation, globalization and their heterogeneous effects across workers and places\nTopic 7: Voter turnout\nCauses and consequences of voter participation\nTopic 8: Polarization and Populism\n-- Second midterm or Full Exam --\nReadings/Bibliography\nThe course has no single textbook. Readings and teaching materials (e.g., slides, notes, exercises) for each class will be published on the university platform VIRTUALE: https://virtuale.unibo.it/\nBelow are some of the readings that I will cover, fully or partly, during classes. This list is partial and will likely be updated before and/or during the course. A thorough understanding of many of these readings requires technical skills beyond what students are expected to have at this point in their academic careers. In such cases, in class I will present simplified versions of the underlying theoretical models (for theory readings) or an introductory review of the econometric results (for empirical readings).\nTo get access to any Harvard Business Case Studies used in the course (e.g., in discussing externalities), please wait for instructions from the lecturer. Specifically, about one week before each case study-based class, the lecturer will send a message on Virtuale explaining where and how to download the relevant cases.\n\n \nTopic 1: Introduction\nRequired readings:\n\nAcemoglu, Daron, “Why Nation-Building Failed in Afghanistan.” Project Syndicate, August 20, 2021, https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/afghanistan-top-down-state-building-failed-again-by-daron-acemoglu-2021-08 Last Access: February 12, 2024.\nAcemoglu, Daron, Suresh Naidu, Pascual Restrepo, and James A.

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course aims to introduce students to the theory and practice of management. At the end of the course students can understand the main activities and concepts of operations and supply chain management. This area is taken as a metaphor and laboratory to study concepts, such as efficiency and effectiveness, that are then useful for all courses in management. At the end of the course students can control operating processes and manage activities of market oriented companies by defining the strategic framework in which a company operates.\nCourse contents\nManagement involves leading and directing an organization, through frameworks and activities that use and combine different types of resources. As such, the main topics to be addressed in the course include the notion of organization as an open system, made of interdependent internal elements, the organizational environment, the challenges of organizational design, the different organizational structures, and people management, among others.\nThe course will cover the following topics:\n\nDefinition of management\nThe role of managers in organizations\nOrganizing people\nThe competitive environment\nInternal analysis\nBusiness models, platforms, ecosystems\nCompetitive advantage\nBusiness strategies\nCorporate strategies\nEntrepreneurial strategies\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nSelected chapters from the following textbooks:\nJones, G. Organizational Theory, Design, and Change, 7th Edition, Pearson Education. Global Edition\nGrant, R. M. Contemporary strategy analysis, 10th Edition, John Wiley & Sons.\nAdditional readings will be used as a basis for class discussion and included in the final Syllabus available on Virtuale at the beginning of the course.\nTeaching methods\nLectures, discussion of case studies, and group works.\nAssessment methods\nFor attending students, the assessment is based on two elements:\na) the written exam grade\nb) a group work (compulsory if attending).\nThe written exams are organized as follows:\nOption 1. one intermediate exam after the first half of the classes with multiple choice questions of 20 minutes (mid-term 1) plus a second written multiple choice exam during the regular exam sessions on the second part of the course (final exam) for students who have taken the first intermediate exam (duration 20 minutes);\nOption 1a. A final exam on the whole course during the regular exam sessions, for students who have not taken or rejected the mark of the first mid-term (duration 40 minutes).\nIMPORTANT: The vote obtained for the first intermediate exam will be valid until the first exam session (\"primo appello\"). From the second exam session onwards (\"secondo appello\"), the exam will be organized only as a full exam on the material of the whole course, lasting 40 minutes. However, you will still be able to keep the group work mark.\nFor the students who decide to take the intermediate exam (option 1 above)\n\nEach of the two intermediate exams will be evaluated from 0 to 30L (18 is pass grade). The evaluation for the written individual exam consists of the arithmetic mean of the evaluations obtained in the two intermediate tests. If the arithmetic mean is >=18, then this score will be further averaged with the mark obtained from the group work and can be registered if >=18.\n\nFor the students who opt for option 1a above\n\nStudents receiving an evaluation of at least 18/30 can register their mark if the average between this mark and the group work is >=18.\n\nFor non-attending students (students that do not participate in group work and do not attend classes regularly), an individual exam will be assigned on the whole course material in one of the regular exam sessions (\"appelli\") (duration 40 minutes).\nPlease refer to the Syllabus published on Virtuale at the beginning of the course for details on the group work (structure, grading).\nGrades:\n<18 fail\n18-23, sufficient\n24-27, good\n28-30, very good\n30 e lode, excellent\n \nStudents with specific learning disorders (SLD) or temporary/permanent disabilities should contact the appropriate University office (https://site.unibo.it/studenti-con-disabilita-e-dsa/en ) immediately and agree with the teacher the most effective strategies for attending the lectures and preparing for the exam.\nTeaching tools\nTeaching material prepared by the Professor (lecture slides, readings, case studies) and uploaded on Virtuale.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Leonardo Corbo"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course stundents can understand operations of market oriented companies. Students can manage activities of market oriented companies by defining strategic framework by analysing competition and market segments; students are also able to manage and control operating porcesses.\nCourse contents\nManagement is the process which requires leading and directing an organization, through techniques and activities to use and combine different types of resources. The resources are namely: human, financial, material, intellectual, intangible. Every management course covers to some extent the five management functions: Planning, Organizing, Leading, Co-ordinating, Controlling.\nIn this course, after introducing the main issues related to the activities and contexts of management, we mainly discuss the principles, techniques and steps to use, plan, organize, lead, coordinate and control material resources. The four essential core areas of operations management and supply chain management are thus analyzed: strategy, process management, supply chain management, and inventory and control (supply and demand planning). Such concepts are integrated by the idea of sustainability as a strategic consideration. The course includes updated company applications, problems, and cases.\nThe main sections of this course are:\n-Introduction: this course of Principles of Management and its relation to the \"Corso di Laurea in Business and Economics\"\n-Definition of management and main concepts and activities\n-Firms and customers, what is a firm, how firms interact with each other, how customers (consumers and customer firms) changed in the last decades, the impact of new technology on the workplace\n-Regulating context: general norms, antitrust regulation and consumer protection, governmental regulation about products, prices and the workplace\n-Corporate social responsibility and business ethics: the internal and external impact of company behaviour on society\n- Operations and supply chain management\n- Strategy and sustainability\n- Strategic capacity management\n\n- Learning curves\n\n- Manufacturing processes\n\n- Break-even analysis\n\n- Sales and operations planning\n\n- Material requirements planning\n\n- Inventory management\n\n- Lean supply chains\n\n- Global sourcing and procurement\n\n- Location, logistics, and distribution\n\n- Linear programming using the excel solver\n- Business planning\nReadings/Bibliography\nTextbook:\nFrom McGrawHill it is available a compact edition of the book, specifically packaged for our course, which only includes the chapters that are relevant for our course; this makes the book price lower for students.\nTITLE:\n\nCorso di Principles of Management - Estratto da Jacobs & Chase – Operations and Supply Chain Management-The Core 5a ed.\nAngelo Manaresi - Università di Bologna - \nLaurea in Business and Economics –\nCLABE - Anno Accademico 2020-21\nPUBLISHER: MCGRAW-HILL\nIMPORTANT, TO FIND THE RIGHT BOOK:\nISBN code 978-13-076-0808-3\nCHAPTERS INCLUDED:\nChapter 1 - Operations and supply chain management\nChapter 2 - Strategy and sustainability\nChapter 4 - Strategic capacity management\nChapter 4A - Learning curves\nChapter 6 - Manufacturing processes\nChapter 6A - Break-even analysis\nChapter 8 - Sales and operations planning\nChapter 9 - Material requirements planning\nChapter 11 - Inventory management\nChapter 12 - Lean supply chains\nChapter 13 - Global sourcing and procurement\nChapter 14 - Location, logistics, and distribution\nAppendix a - Linear programming using the excel solver\nAppendix b - Answers to selected objective questions\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nAlternatively, if you have previous editions of the book \nTitle: Operations and Supply Chain Management – The Core – International Edition\nAuthors: F.

For that exam session, only a full exam including the whole course program will be organized, with open questions, of about 60-70 minutes.\nStudents of previous years must prepare the program of the current year and can only take a full exam on the whole program.\nThe exam, both intermediate and final, has the following goals:\n· knowledge of principles of management concepts discussed during lectures , case studies and exercises.\n· capability of applying operation and supply management tools to manage companies.\n· ability to use results from management models to understand business activities and decision processes, both at the strategic and operational level.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor the students who decide to take the intermediate exam (that will take place in last part of October or at the beginning of November):\n-the intermediate exam will be evaluated from 0 to 30 (18 is pass grade);\n-a student can take part in the exam on the second part of hte program only if he/she has passed the intermediate, that is to say with an evaluation of at least 18/30;\n-in case of passing the exam on the second part, which means taking at least the score of 18/30, the final grade of the couse of Principles of Management will be the arithmetic mean of the evaluations obtained in the two partial tests.\n \nIf a student decides to be evaluated by participating in an exam session including both parts of the program, the evaluation is, as usual, 0 to 30 (18 is the pass grade).\n\nTo take the exam, registration is required through the Almaesami electronic system, in compliance with the deadlines provided.\n\nThe registration of the grade achieved is done in the Almaesami system. It is possible to view the exam paper and ask for clarifications on the date indicated by the teacher. The possibility of using alternative time to view the exam paper is reserved for exceptional cases, with a valid motivation. The registration of the vote on Almaesami system will take place without the need of the student to be present or sign it.\n\nGraduating students who pass the exam and need to register the grade before the planned date, are invited to communicate it to the teacher through an email to be sent immediately after taking the exam.\n\nAs said before, the exam is carried out in writing and provides an evaluation in a scale from 0 to 30 (18 is a passing grade). In addition to answering some questions concerning the methods (\"theory questions\"), students will have to perform exercises in which they demonstrate the ability to apply the acquired tools to manage a specific practical situation in management, operation and supply chain management, verify specific hypotheses and interpret the achieved results.\n\nDuring the exam test, the use of support material such as textbooks, notes, computer or telematic media is not allowed. A student is able to pass the written test (and to also acquire the maximum assessment provided) even without attending classes, given that attendance is not mandatory; however, statistically this rarely happens.\nTeaching tools\nExcel files with management models; case, excercises and videos will be discussed in class. Students will sometime be asked to read a specific case study before class.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Angelo Manaresi"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course tries to discover how special financial intermediaries, venture capitalists and private equity investors, finance companies belonging to different stages of their life-cycle, starting from the very beginning (startup and early stage) to a more mature phase (i.e. expansion, mature age, etc.) and discuss the role of Financial Technology (FinTech) in changing  the financial industry and reduce the information frictions to help close financing gaps existing in the economy.\nCourse contents\n  Private equity is an increasingly important part of the financial landscape. The global private equity sector grew from $870 billion in 2004 to over $4.7 trillion at the beginning of 2021. Their enthusiasm of investors –even in hard times of pandemic – for this asset class is understandable: pension funds, government funds, and university endowments are in many cases facing financial shortfalls and are desperate for high returns. Then there is the global dimension. Private equity originated in the U.S. and for much of its history, the industry was concentrated in that nation and the United Kingdom. Over the past fifteen years, however, private equity has become much more global. Not only has the capital disbursed in continental Europe and Asia increased sharply, but also emerging markets (especially China and India) have become far more important in the private equity landscape. This course focuses on the understanding of  private equity & venture capital business overall, starting from the perspective of investors, and moving to entrepreneurs. We then move to  finTech that  covers digital innovations and technology-enabled business model innovations in the financial sector. Such innovations can disrupt existing industry structures and blur industry boundaries, facilitate strategic disintermediation,  revolutionize how existing firms create and deliver products and services, provide new gateways for entrepreneurship, democratize access to financial services, but also create significant privacy, regulatory and law enforcement challenges. Examples of innovations that are central to FinTech today include cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, new digital advisory and trading systems, artificial intelligence and machine learning, peer-to-peer lending, equity crowdfunding and mobile payment systems.\nReadings/Bibliography\npapers from international scientific journals and slides on Virtuale.\nTeaching methods\nFrontal teaching. Theoretical Models will be discussed and developed in class. Particular attention will be devoted to the understanding of model background and empirical implications as well as discussion on policy issues.\nAssessment methods\nFinal written examination.\nThe written exam aims at testing the acquired knowledge of the theoretical concepts and the ability to interpret estimation results in the light of the underlying theory.\n\nThe written exam is closed book and lasts 1 hour and 15 minutes. It is divided in two parts:\n\nTrue , False, Uncertain (answer with concise motivation): 6 questions, 30 points\nOpen question (formal answer to theoretical question): 1 question, 30 points.\n\n\nIn case online exams will be envisaged by the University of Bologna, the structure of the written exam is the same. The exam will be run through Zoom and Exams Online (EOL). Detailed instructions on how to manage and hand in the online exam are available on the course page on the VIRTUALE platform.\nThe maximum possible score is 30 cum laude, in case all anwers are correct, complete and formally rigorous.\nThe grade is graduated as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\nTeaching tools\ncases studies will be assigned in class and discussed.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Laura Bottazzi"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the class, student has knowledge of the debate regarding pension’s policy and how it affects individuals, a debate which interests policy and academic audiences. He/she has knowledge of the lifecycle model as a key tool for analysing the issues of interest and for understanding existing analyses. Finally, student knows topical policy questions and the recent contributions to the academic literature about how individuals are affected by, and respond to, public policy.\nCourse contents\nThe course focuses on the role for government intervention in the economy (why should government intervene?), and on some principles that might guide the design of economic policy.\nAs a particular example, the course may consider public policy regarding pensions / social security, and how this affects the decisions of individuals regarding consumption and saving.\nTopics may therefore include:\n\nMotives for government intervention in the economy\nRaising government revenue:\n    \nOptimal income taxation\nOptimal commodity taxation\n\n\nPensions and social security\n    \nHow is policy designed?\nHow do agents respond to policy interventions?\n\n\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nBasic graduate / advanced undergraduate textbooks include:\nGruber, J., Public Finance and Public Policy\nHindriks, J., and Myles G.D., Intermediate Public Economics\nA more advanced text is:\nAtkinson A. B., and Stiglitz, J.

This volume is available here: ifs.org.uk/publications/5353\nTeaching methods\nTraditional lectures led by the course lecturer. Potentially also lessons to work through exercises led by course lecturer.\nStudents are likely to be asked to present material to lead discussion on some topics. The use of such innovative teaching methods will be adapted depending on class size.\nAssessment methods\nAssessment will be based on a final written exam, and on the lecturer’s assessment of student performance in class presentation(s).\nThe final written exam of about one or one and a half hours.\nThe exam will be a combination of exercises and open (essay) questions. Example questions will be provided during the course.\nThe exam will be “closed book” and so during exams students will NOT be allowed to use materials such as: textbooks, lecture notes/slides; any written notes; web-enabled or data storage devices such as computers (laptops or tablets), or smartphones. Candidates found with such items will be disciplined.\nThe content and structure of exam questions is intended to assess familiarity with the material covered in the course lectures, and, in particular, to assess understanding of the implications for public economics of the material covered in the course.\nDue to the ongoing health emergency, it is possible that exams may need to be administered “online” for some or all students. This will not affect the structure of the exam. Online exams would be administered using a combination of two software packages: ZOOM and EOL (esami online).\nCandidates will be required to enroll for exams via the University's electronic service (currently AlmaEsami). Exam marks will be published via the University's electronic service (AlmaEsami). After exams students will be entitled to see their script by attending the lecturer’s office hour.\nStudents will be allowed to reject their final grade for the course exactly ONCE. When exam results are published, the date by which students must notify the course lecturer of their intention to reject their mark, will be communicated to candidates. Notification of the intention to reject must be sent in writing (by email). After the date specified, marks will be electronically registered (verbalizzato).\nDetails of assessment based on the lecturer’s assessment of student performance in class presentations will be provided at the outset of the course. Presentations will most likely be based on recent papers from academic literature.\nFinal grades for the course will be out of 30. A grade of at least 18 is required to pass the course, and the maximum is 30 with distinction (“30 e lode”). As a guide, the grade scale (for “pass” grades) can be thought of as follows:\n\n·- 18 – 22: Adequate\n·- 23 – 25: Good\n·- 26 – 27: Very good\n·- 28 – 30: Excellent\n·- 30 e lode: Outstanding\n\n \nTeaching tools\nSlides\nExample exercises\nPossibly, lecture notes.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Matthew John Wakefield"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThis course considers a broad array of business strategies that firms adopt when they compete with rivals, or when they decide to collaborate. In particular, it aims to combine a sound theoretical analysis of strategic decisions along with their managerial implications. On the one hand, the economic theory of strategic behaviour often neglects the real context in which firms operate. On the other hand, the simple analysis of case studies may lead only to a partial interpretation of such strategic behaviour. By taking this course, participants will understand both the economic rationale and the practical implications of adopting different business strategies in contexts such as: strategic innovation, competitive advantage, standard adoption and compatibility, network effects, and coopetition.\nCourse contents\n1. Pricing strategies and market segmentation\nThis part of the course discusses the strategies that firms may adopt in order to segment markets and, potentially, extract more consumer surplus by effectively selling at different prices to different consumers.\nThe availability of different price discrimination strategies depends on how well a firm knows its consumers’ willingness to pay and which type of tariff instruments it can use.\nThe effects that these various forms of price discrimination have on profits and on welfare depend crucially on the degree of competition in the industry. In monopolistic industries, more information and a wider range of tariff instruments can only increase the firm’s profits (at the expense of consumer surplus, the effect on welfare being ambiguous). In oligopolistic industries (or in monopoly markets in which the monopolist lacks commitment power), however, it is much less clear whether more information and more instruments translate into higher profits. The positive surplus-extracting effect of price discrimination may be offset by its negative competition-enhancing effect.\n2. Asymmetric information on product quality/markets for experience goods\nHere, we examine products and services with characteristics that can only be ascertained upon consumption because they are difficult to observe in advance. We talk here of experience goods.\n\nManaging experience goods is the day-to-day concern of large firms selling consumer goods. These firms frequently introduce new branded products. They are always interested in convincing consumers that the new product satisfies their wants. Perhaps the main challenge when launching a new product is that consumers do not observe the quality of the product, as is typically the case with experience goods. Similarly, firms that enter an otherwise perfectly competitive industry with a patented product (or, alternatively, open new markets with a proprietary technology) often produce an experience good.\n\nThese markets are characterized by asymmetric information as consumers have less information than the producers about product quality. In such markets, firms have to convince consumers that their products are of high quality. To this end, firms can use a variety of marketing instruments.\n3. Strategic incumbency and entry decisions\nIf entry barriers in an industry are sufficiently large, entry is said to be blockaded for additional firms. In some markets, entry barriers are at a level that only a single firm can enter. In such a situation, the single incumbent firm can behave as a monopolist without fearing entry. In contrast, for lower entry barriers, entry is a threat that the incumbent cannot ignore. Facing potential entry, the incumbent will thus react strategically with a view either to make entry unprofitable or, at least, to minimize the harm that entry causes. Entry is said to be deterred in the former case, and accommodated in the latter.\nBecause an incumbent is already established in the industry, it has the advantage of being able to act before a potential entrant decides whether or not to enter. However, acting before is not sufficient to influence the entrant’s decision: the incumbent must also act in a credible way. A threat to make the entrant’s life impossible or hard if it enters can only be effective if this threat is turned into a commitment. That is, the incumbent’s action must modify its incentives in such a way that if entry was to happen, it would be in the incumbent’s best interest to carry out the threat.\n\nTo achieve such commitment, the incumbent will invest prior to entry and in an irreversible way in some strategic variable that will affect its future conduct and, thereby, the profits the entrant could attain upon entry. It may also affect directly the entry cost so that this cost becomes endogenous.\n4. Vertically related markets\nFirms that sell products usually require inputs, which are produced by other firms in an upstream industry (which again may require inputs from other firms). This leads to a vertical supply chain that is needed to produce a final product.\nInputs are often provided by firms with market power. We then have to take the whole vertical supply chain into account to understand how markets function. For instance, can upstream firms deny competitors access to their distribution channel, for example, because they have signed an exclusive dealing contract with their retailers? Also, what are the effects of vertical mergers?\n \nPrerequisite knowledge\nIndustrial economics - Master's level [https://www.unibo.it/en/study/phd-professional-masters-specialisation-schools-and-other-programmes/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2023/492161] and Microeconomics - Master's level [2024/2025 MODELING INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOUR — University of Bologna (unibo.it) [https://www.unibo.it/en/study/phd-professional-masters-specialisation-schools-and-other-programmes/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2024/492155]\nReadings/Bibliography\nBelleflamme, Paul, and Martin Peitz. Industrial organization: markets and strategies. Cambridge University Press, 2015.\nTeaching methods\nDuring the lectures, the presentation of theoretical issues will be complemented by critical discussion of case studies and/or recent academic publications.\nAssessment methods\nStudents will be assessed based on four weakly problem-sets, and a final in-class exam.\nThe final examination aims at evaluating the achievement of the following goals:\n- knowledge of the models discussed in class\n- ability to use the acquired knowledge to solve practical exercses.\nThe problem sets will be published on the course' e-learning platform.\nIn the problem-sets (accounting for 5% of the mark each) students will have to comment or interpret graphs, figures and equations from the studies discussed in class, or briefly summarize the results. For the problem-sets teamwork is allowed but in the end each student will have to hand in his own answer, and “carbon-copied” works will be strongly penalized.\nThe final exam (80% of the mark) will last 2 hours, and will include a set of 6 questions of increasing complexity, covering both the mathematical/analytical aspects of the models discussed in class and their interpretation.\nThe maximum possible score is 30 cum laude, in case all answers are correct, complete and formally rigorous.\nThe grade is graduated as follows:\n<18 failed\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 e lode excellent\nThe exam will be held in the computer lab. Questions will be randomly extracted from a predefined set, so the exam content will be different for each student. In case online exams will be envisaged by the University of Bologna, the structure of the written exam is the same. The exam will be run through Zoom and Exams Online (EOL). Detailed instructions on how to manage and hand in the online exam are available on the course page on the VIRTUALE platform.\nIn the final exam students may use calculators (but not other electronic devices), but they may not communicate with others, consult notes, books, or other written material. Any attempt to violate these rules will result in the student's exclusion from the exam.\nAt the end of the course, students have the opportunity to choose one paper at the frontier of the literature and briefly discuss it in a short presentation. The presentation is optional, and can lead to a marginal increase (or decrease) of the final grade.\nTeaching tools\nCase studies will be discussed to introduce each topic.\nLecture notes will be made available before each class on the Virtuale platform.\nThe four problem sets will also be published and graded on Virtuale.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Maria Bigoni"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe aim of the course is to present the fundamental microeconomic justifications of regulatory intervention in the healthcare sector in response to market failures, and to discuss incentive-based remedies and their limitations. The broad topic focuses on health service financing and insurance markets in developed countries.\n\nTeaching practice supports theoretical considerations with an in-depth discussion of the institutional features of different forms of intervention in healthcare markets and with the presentation of case-studies regarding the practice of health insurance in various European countries and the US. \n\nAt the end of the course, the student is expected to reach a detailed knowledge on: 1) the main reasons of market and government failures in the healthcare sector; 2) the trade-offs characterizing public intervention in financing and delivery of health services; 3) the role of economic incentives in regulatory policies; 4) the role, limitations and potential solutions of regulatory intervention in health insurance markets (e.g. including long term care); 6) European countries and US health insurance design and regulatory frameworks.\nCourse contents\nThe course is divided into two distinct parts, each worth 6 credits (30 hours). The first part covers the regulation of healthcare services delivery and is assigned to Professor Matteo Lippi Bruni (MLB). The second part covers the regulation of insurance markets in the healthcare sector and is assigned to Professor Luke Connelly (LC).\nContents\nFirst Part (MLB)\n\nMarket failures in health care.\nRegulating market structure: the normative approach to the health care market.\nThe political economy of the health care sector.\nProvider behavior under different payment mechanisms\nPayment systems in primary care.\nPay for perfomance.\nHospital providers under cost-based reimbursement and prospective payments.\n\nSecond Part (LC)\n\nIntroduction to Insurance and Health Insurance\nThe Welfare Economics of Insurance\n Market Failure in Health Insurance Markets\n Asymmetric Information in Health Insurance Markets\n Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard in Health Insurance Markets\n Life and Limb and the “Judgement Proof” Problem\n Insurance Market Regulation: Problems of Market and Government Failure\n Case Studies in Health Insurance\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nReadings/bibliography\nFirst Part (MLB)\nSelected chapters from:\nGlied, S. and Smith P C.

Class discussion and individual presentation of a scientific paper chosen by the student at the beginning of the course. \nSecond Part- (LC)\nTraditional lectures, Student-Faculty Discussions (including “journal club”, debate, and discussion of relevant contemporary regulatory/market issues)\nLectures\nThe course includes traditional lectures, and the essential readings (marked with an asterisk (*), above) which are used to introduce the key concepts and evidence. These will also be supplemented by further reading and online resources, which will be available on the course’s teaching page.\n“Journal Club”\nIn addition to traditional lectures and readings, student participation is a central part of the course design and learning methods. Between one-third-to-one-half of most classroom sessions (apart from the introductory class) will involve the direct participation in discussion and debate. Tasks will include discussions in a “journal club” format: one or more class members will be asked to lead a discussion of a nominated paper; and typically at least one more student will be asked to be the “secondary” discussant of the paper. The role of the nominees is not to provide a presentation of the paper, but to lead the class discussion by preparing questions and comments about the paper. All class members will be expected to have read the paper and to contribute to discussion. The purpose of this approach is primarily to encourage students to bring the course materials to bear on the selected topics (together with their own knowledge and experience, where relevant) to encourage a critical discussion of the course contents and their relevance to contemporary issues. \nDebate\nDiscussions and debate will be encouraged through the “journal club” approach and may also involve the nomination of a contemporary topic for debate. For instance, students may be allocated to “Affirmative” and “Negative” teams and asked to debate a nominated topic using the concepts from the course and their own critical review of the literature. \nAssessment methods\nAssessment methods \nFirst part (MLB)\nWritten exam – 85% - Class Presentation 15%\nSecond part (LC)\nThere are three elements of assessment:\nContributions to Classroom Discussion/Debate (10%)\nGroup Debate: Essay and Presentation (30%)\nFinal examination (60%)\nContributions to Classroom Discussion/Debate (10%)\nContributions to the classroom discussions and debate are worth 10% of the final grade for this course. Contributions to debate obviously involve participation in debate, but the contribution to a debate depends on how much the participant influences a discussion by asking meaningful questions or making thought-provoking points. (This distinction will be discussed briefly in the first lecture.)\nGroup Debate: Essay and Presentation (30%)\nThis item of assessment will be conducted in groups. Groups will be allocated by Professor Connelly (the size and number of groups to be partly determined by total enrolment in the course). The groups will be required to produce an essay arguing in the Affirmative or the Negative on a topic nominated by the Professor. The essay grade will comprise half of the total for this assessment item (i.e., will be graded out of a maximum of 15 marks). The Debate will require each group member to present part of the argument (e.g., opening, middle, closing), with alternating presentations by the opposing team (e.g., Team 1 Group Member 1 speaks first, followed by Team 2 Group Member 2, and so on) in the form of a debate. (Members of the same team will be allowed to collude during the course of the debate—except during the presentation of a team member who “has the floor”—if they want to do so.) The presentation/debate component of this assessment item is also worth 15 marks.\nNote: as a rule, both the essay and presentation marks will be awarded as group marks. In the event of wide disparities in the performance of team members, though, individual marks for the oral part of this assessment item may be invoked.\nFinal Examination (60%)\nThe final essay examination will be of 2 hours duration with 10 minutes’ perusal time. Students will choose two (2) essays from four (4) options, with each essay response to be afforded equal weight for this item. Students will be permitted to bring one double-sided sheet of A4 paper of notes to the examination and to rely upon it during the exam. Calculators and other electronic devices, including phones, are neither required nor permitted to be used during the examination.\nTeaching tools\nDetailed syllabus and teaching material will be available on the e-learning website of the course (Virtuale platform)\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Matteo Lippi Bruni\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Luke Brian Connelly"

The course is designed specifically for students interested in doing empirical academic research. At the end of the course, students should be able to prepare a research proposal for a (feasible) empirical study and to deliver a short presentation about the research question, empirical strategy, and planned data work.\nCourse contents\nNote (particularly for Erasmus students): By the beginning of classes, all students are expected to (1) have successfully completed a graduate econometrics course and (2) have good working familiarity with the econometric software Stata.\nTaking the course WITHOUT having already taken one or more graduate/Master's-level econometric courses AND without prior knowledge of Stata is extremely discouraged.\n\nResearch proposal and presentation: Your grade will be based on a four-page research proposal and a 15-minute presentation thereof.\nClass Participation: Active participation in all classes, including your classmates’ presentations, is highly, highly, highly (yes, I wrote that three times) recommended.\nSketch of Potential Research Ideas: In the last week of classes, I will meet each of you individually to discuss your research idea(s), which will then culminate in the afore-said research proposal and presentation. Finding decent, viable research ideas is challenging, so you should start thinking about that ASAP. Once you have a couple of decent ones, please send me a succinct 1-page description structured along the lines I will describe in the first (or second class).\nPaper Readings for First Week of Classes: In the first week of classes, we will discuss a few empirical papers.

A Countrywide Experiment on Voter Choice in France,” American Economic Review, 2018, 108(6), 1322-1363.\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nThough the class will not be based on any specific textbook, there are a number of potentially useful sources:\n\nEconometrics: if you are interested in doing applied economics for a living, Angrist and Pischke’s Mostly Harmless Econometrics and Mastering ‘Metrics are fundamental references.\nCoding: Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro’s Code and Data for the Social Sciences is an essential reading for any economist working with data: https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.xhtml\nWriting: two good references are The Sense of Style, by Steven Pinker, and The Elements of Style, by William Strunk. The former is an outstanding general style manual, while the latter is a succinct, albeit slightly outdated guide to polished writing. Jesse Shapiro’s notes on writing an Applied Micro Paper are also great and freely available: http://www.brown.edu/Research/Shapiro/pdfs/foursteps.pdf\nPresenting: Jesse Shapiro is (again) a valuable free source of information on how to give an applied micro talk. His notes are available here: http://www.brown.edu/Research/Shapiro/pdfs/applied_micro_slides.pdf I also strongly recommend this outstanding book by Jonathan Schwabish: http://cup.columbia.edu/book/better-presentations/9780231175210\n\nTeaching methods\nTeaching Methods\nClass/Date: Activities -- Deliverables\nWeek 1: Reading an econ paper -- Skim intro of papers listed above\nWeek 2: Stata coding session -- Bring your laptop w/ Stata on it!\nWeek 3: Writing an econ paper -- \nWeek 4: Presenting an econ paper --\nWeek 5: 1-on-1 meetings -- Sketch(es) of research idea(s) due\nTBD: -- Research proposals due\nTBD: -- 1st round of students’ presentations\nTBD: -- 2nd round of students’ presentations\nAssessment methods\nThe class is graded on a 0-30-cum-laude basis based on:\n\na max 5-page research proposal (that you'll deliver by a date TBD between the end of March and the beginning of April) -- max 15 points towards your final grade;\na 15-minute presentation thereof (max 15 points towards your final grade);\nactive class participation (max 4 points towards your final grade).\n\nThe maximum possible grade is 30 cum laude (for total scores > 30), in case the research proposal is novel, scientifically interesting, feasible, the in-class presentation makes justice to the high quality of the proposal, and the student participates regularly and actively in class. If that is not the case, the following grading scheme applies:\n<18 fail\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 cum laude: excellent\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Enrico Cantoni"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course, students will have a knowledge of the principles of the economic analysis of consumption and saving, and potentially also labour-supply, over the lifecycle. The economic models that are applied are dynamic and may incorporate uncertainty. Knowledge of these principles allows students to look at recent literature on how the economic choices of households can be influenced by the amounts and types of assets that they own, and to understand why the strength of macroeconomic responses to shocks and public-policy interventions will often depend on which households are most affected by the shock or by the policy intervention.\nCourse contents\nIn the first part of the course students will become familiar with standard economic models of the consumption and savings decisions of households. The model will first be developed in a two-period setup with no uncertainty. Extensions to a longer-horizon and to the case of uncertainty will then be added. Labour-supply decisions might be considered.\nThe second part of the course will look at applications. Examples could include:\n\nThe literature on how consumption and saving (and possibly labour-supply) respond to resource shocks. These shocks could be to financial wealth, or to (expected) labour incomes.\nThe relationship between house prices, the consumption spending of households and aggregate consumption.\nHow stimulus payments (to support consumption during economic downturns) affect the behaviour of different families, and whether the macroeconomic efficacy of stimulus packages can be affected by who receives support.\nUsing the model framework to think about how (temporary) changes in sales taxes (VAT) can be used as a policy to stimulate consumption and economic activity.\n\nThroughout the course, we will keep in mind how institutions and public policy decisions might be shaping the decisions of households and so the evolution of the economy.\nReadings/Bibliography\nSpecific readings, appropriate for the applications to be discussed, will be provided at the beginning of the course. The following might provide some useful background.\nThe baseline models of intertemporal choice are described in standard microeconomics texts (see Chapter 10 of Varian, Intermediate Microeconomics, 9th International student edition, chapter 10) and also some intermediate macroeconomics texts.\nSections 7.1 and 7.2 of Attanasio and Wakefield (2010), “The Effects on Consumption and Saving of Taxing Asset Returns” (chapter 7 of Dimensions of Tax Design, volume 1 of the Mirrlees Review of tax design). The chapter is available here: https://ifs.org.uk/uploads/mirrleesreview/dimensions/ch7.pdf\nGreg Kaplan and Giovanni Violante offer an accessible account of one potential application of the theory on the Microeconomic Insights page here: https://microeconomicinsights.org/wealthy-hand-to-mouth-households-key-to-understanding-the-impacts-of-fiscal-stimulus/\nCopies of teaching materials (slides, exercises) will be published on the university platform Virtuale.\nTeaching methods\nTraditional lectures led by the course lecturer. Class discussion.\nAssessment methods\nThe main tool for assessment will be a short, written exam. The exam will be administered in person. Only in an emergency situation may in be necessary to administer the written exam “online” for some or all students. The structure of the exam will not be affected by the mode in which it is administered. The exam will likely include short-answer exercises and essay-type question(s).\nThe written test could be supplemented by a short project.\nFinal grades for the course will be out of 30. A grade of at least 18 is required to pass the course, and the maximum is 30 with distinction (“30 e lode”). As a guide, the grade scale (for “pass” grades) can be thought of as follows:\n\n18 – 22: Adequate\n23 – 25: Good\n26 – 27: Very good\n28 – 30: Excellent\n30 e lode: Outstanding\n\nTeaching tools\nSlides. Handouts. Lecture notes.\nStudents with a disability or specific learning disabilities (DSA) are required to make their condition known in order that the best possible accommodation to their needs may be found.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Matthew John Wakefield\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Pietro Biroli"

By the end of the workshop, students will have improved their ability to discuss research topics in English, to explore the topics studied in depth using international literature as well as to conduct small comparative literature searches and to translate this knowledge into a short paper written using word processing systems.\nPart of the lectures will be given by historians and political scientists mainly coming from foreign universities such as university of Trier, Sciences Po Lyon, Berlin Humboldt, Potsdam, Dresden.\n The schedule of lectures will be announced before the start of the second semester and will publish on virtuale.unibo.it\nThe lecturer coordinating the seminar will explain to the students how to write the paper according to a historical perspective. \nTo understand the type of lectures the student can look at the list of last year's lectures.\nStudents with SLD or temporary or permanent disabilities. It is suggested that they get in touch as soon as possible with the relevant University office (https://site.unibo.it/studenti-con-disabilita-e-dsa/en) and with the lecturer in order to seek together the most effective strategies for following the lessons and/or preparing for the examination.\nReadings/Bibliography\nReadings are planned to enable interested students to explore the topics covered in class in greater depth. These readings are not compulsory for students who regularly attend the class. To the Students with more than 4 absences the teacher will assign on a group of readings to be discussed in the final examination. The readings as well as the Guideliens for writing the final paper will be published on virtuale unibo\nTeaching methods\nLectures with seminar discussions.\nAssessment methods\nAt the end of the seminar students will write a short paper, in Italian (if they are BA Students of DAMS, SPOSI and SVIC) or in English (if they are BA students in in Economics, politics and social sciences and MA Students in legal studies), accompanied by a bibliography on one of the topics covered by the visiting professors. The size of the paper must be at least 25,000 characters (counting spaces and footnotes, but excluding the bibliography). International exchange students can write in English or if they are Native speaker in French or German.\nThe assessment will be the result of the evaluation of the paper and the final interview.\nOn Virtuale Unibo, students will download the editorial rules and criteria for writing the paper, which they must adhere to during the drafting phase.\nAt the end of the seminar, The teacher will assign the topics to all participants and schedule individual meetings with each student in order to assist in setting up the research work. After the meeting, students will then have to construct a bibliography and a paper’s table of contents that should be approved by the teacher and then proceed to writing. The method of delivery of the paper will be indicated during the seminar.\n\nDuring a dedicated meeting, the seminar coordinator will explain how to prepare the paper and the deadlines for its delivery. \nAttendance\nStudents are expected to attend at least 70 per cent of the lessons (11 lectures). Students who for justified reasons (overlap with other courses) fall below this threshold should agree additional work with the lecturer to compensate for absences (readings to be discussed during the final exame).\nStudents with SLD or temporary or permanent disabilities. It is necessary to contact the relevant University office (https://site.unibo.it/studenti-con-disabilita-e-dsa/en) with ample time in advance: the office will propose some adjustments, which must in any case be submitted at least 15 days in advance to the lecturer, who will assess the appropriateness of these in relation to the teaching objectives.\nTeaching tools\nbeamer and other audiovisual tools\nLinks to further information\nhttps://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/stefano.cavazza\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Stefano Cavazza"

Note that concepts and theories that I will present in the lectures are not specifically developed for the cultural industry; rather they apply to the vast majority of BtoC services. This approach reflects the choice to avoid the “we are different” syndrome. In other words, the services marketing logic can be applied independently of the context. Context requires adaptations and fine-tuning but not new theories.\nb) Project Works\nAssessment methods\nExams are necessary to assess your mastery of core concepts. The three exams per year given in this class will cover the book chapters indicated in the syllabus.\nExams will consist of 4 open-ended questions and or multiple choice on the topics covered by the book chapters. The questions are distributed on EOL even if the exams will be held in presence. So, you are required to bring your laptop the day of the exam.\nFor most students, exams will take approximately 45 to complete, but please take your time and remember that you have the 60 minutes to complete it.\nPlease remember that, since this course is tied with Prof. Luca Zan’s course, he will register the final grade (the arithmetic mean) on Almaesami once you have completed both exams.\nThe overall grade is the arithmetic average of the results of the two checks.\n\nThe test assessment grid will be as follows:\n· <18 insufficient\n· 18-23 sufficient\n· 24-27 average/good\n· 28-30 very good\n· 30 cum laude excellent/outstanding\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Chiara Orsingher"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course introduces students to key sociological concepts and topics and encourages the development of skills pertaining to the understanding and investigation of social phenomena from a sociological perspective. Students completing the course will be familiar with the main epistemological orientations in contemporary social science debates; analyze key features of social structure, social inequality, social change and comparative research; critically assess different sociological approaches; make decisions involving the design and execution of social research projects.\nCourse contents\nPlease note: the course is scheduled to begin on Tuesday, September 17th.\nThe course is an introduction to sociology and some basic concepts underlying social research methodology. The course will lay out the fundamental tenets of the discipline, including typical definitions, questions, theories, methods, perspectives and topics. The issues addressed by the course include:\n- the aims of sociology: description of social phenomena, understanding their underlying processes, application of sociological insights\n- the formulation of useful sociological theories and the relevant conceptual tools\n- the goals of empirical research and the types of methods sociologists have at their disposal, with a focus on comparative approaches\n- typical sociological topics, with a special focus on: beliefs, attitudes and values; social norms; social relationships; social stratification, mobility and other topics linked to inequality; immigration; modernization; religion; climate change\n- the distinction between reality, thought and language, the unsteady relationship among which shapes any attempt to attain knowledge about society\n- classical sociological thinkers. \nLessons will not deal with all issues explained in the reference texts listed below and also involve issues not addressed by said texts. The exam is based both on mastery of the reference texts listed below and the additional topics discussed in class.\nBe aware: the course requires a high level of English language proficiency.\nExchange students: carefully read the \"Assessment methods\" section below! \n  \n \nReadings/Bibliography\nReference texts:\n\n- van Tubergen, Frank, Introduction to Sociology, Routledge, 2020\n\n- Corbetta, Piergiorgio, Social Research: Theory, Methods and Techniques, Sage, 2003: chapters 1-3 [https://methods.sagepub.com/book/social-research-theory-methods-and-techniques]\n\n- Falzon, Danielle, J.

Attending students are offered the opportunity to take an (optional) intermediate exam approximately mid-way through the lesson plan (first week of November 2024). The exam is based on the reference texts. \nThe second half of the exam, for those taking the intermediate exam, and the full exam will be offered once in January 2025, once in February 2025 and again in the late August-September 2025 period. Please note the first available period for completing/taking the full exam will be in January; this is unavoidable for all exams in the EPOS degree programme, and interested students (especially international exchange students) need to adapt travel plans accordingly. There will be no alternative dates and no altermative modes for earning credits. If this is pronblematic, do NOT include this course in your study plan.\nExams are administered in exclusively *written* form and *in person*. The only valid mark is the one achieved in the most recent attempt to pass the exam. Students can refuse a passing mark just once.\nThe full written exam comprises approximately 30 multiple-choice questions and approximately 5 open-ended questions. The intermediate exam and the second half of the exam are each slightly shorter.\nPlease note that Art. 25, Paragraph 2 of the Code of Ethics and Conduct of the University of Bologna requires that \"in course exams and degree programme final exams, students must refrain from conduct that may cause disturbance or obstacle or involve harmful and/or dishonest consequences towards other students and the institution. Plagiarism or copying of other people's texts or other behaviours that hinder a correct evaluation of exam performances are contrary to the principles of this Code”.\nTeaching tools\nThe material shown in class will be available on the virtuale.unibo.it website.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Giancarlo Gasperoni"

Examples of past exam papers will be made available at the beginning of the Module. The Module 2 exam is a pass/fail written test. The Module 2 test can be taken on any of the available dates regardless on when the Module 1+3 exam is taken. The Module 1+3 mark will be registered only after passing the Module 2 test. \nStudents taking the Module 1+3 first midterm exam can sit the Module 1+3 second midterm exam only if they obtained a sufficient mark. The Module 1+3 second midterm exam can be taken only once either right at the end of the Module or on the following call. If the student fails the Module 1+3 second midterm exam, he/she will have to resit the Module 1+3 full exam and will lose the mark obtained in the Module 1+3 first midterm exam.\nIn some cases, after the Module 1+3 full or second midterm exam, the lecturer may require an oral test as a further tool of assessment of the student's preparation.\n \n \n\nGrade rejection\nStudents can reject the grade obtained at the Module 1+3 exam once. To this end, he/she must email a request to the instructor within the date that will be specified after the notification of the exam results.\nRejection is intended with respect to the whole Module 1+3 exam. If the grade is rejected, the student must retake the full Module 1+3 exam, even if the second midterm exam was taken. The only grade that can be rejected without any communication from the student is the one of the Module 1+3 first midterm exam: in this case the student can either take the Module 1+3 second midterm exam or sit the Module 1+3 full exam (thus losing the grade obtained in the first midterm exam).\nTeaching tools\nFor topics 1-3 of the \"Course contents\" section: Teaching material (lecture notes, exercises, past exam papers, etc) and further information about the course will be available at the beginning of the course on the platform Virtuale.\nFor topic 4 of the \"Course contents\" section:\n\nunder the \"Teaching\" section of  Filippo Piccinini's personal website all the slides used during the lessons are available for download as well as software tools for practice.\n\n\nThe statistical software R can be freely downloaded from the web page http://http//www.r-project.org/\n\n\nThe software RStudio can be used as an interface for R and can be freely downloaded from the site https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/\n\nLinks to further information\nhttps://virtuale.unibo.it/\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Paola Bortot\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Filippo Piccinini"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nBy the end of the course students have acquired knowledge of the main statistical techniques for exploratory\ndata analysis and the fundamental concepts of probability and inference from random samples. Moreover,\nthey have developed skills to formalize and to solve the basic statistics problems using R.\nCourse contents\nDescriptive Statistics\nBasic concepts. Frequency distributions. Describing data by graphs. Descriptive summary statistics: central tendency and variability measures. Association in contingency tables. Simple linear regression and correlation.\n \nProbability\nBasic concepts and Bayes theorem. Random variables. Central Limit theorem.\n \n\nStatistical Inference\nRandom samples and sampling distribution of statistics. Point and interval estimation. Hypothesis testing.\n \nProgramming (with R)\nIntroduction to R: downloading and installing R (RStudio), R language essentials, data entry. Univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics. Probability distributions. Point estimation, confidence intervals and hypotheses testing.\n \nDuring the course, datasets and examples of applications to economics and social sciences will be illustrated. \n \nReadings/Bibliography\nStatistics textbook:\nG. Cicchitelli, P. D'Urso, M. Minozzo (2021) \"Statistics - Principles and Methods\", first edition. Pearson Italia, Milano-Torino.\n \nProgramming textbook:\nP. Dalgaard (2008) \"Introductory statistics with R\", second edition. Springer, New York, NY.\nTeaching methods\nLectures and lab sessions.\n \nAs concerns the teaching methods of this course unit, all students must attend Module 1, 2 [http://www.unibo.it/en/services-and-opportunities/health-and-assistance/health-and-safety/online-course-on-health-and-safety-in-study-and-internship-areas] on Health and Safety online.\nAssessment methods\nAssessment will take place through written exams (no oral exams). The written test is aimed at assessing the student's ability to use the learned definitions, concepts and properties and in solving exercises. During the written exam, students can use the formula sheet that is provided on virtuale.unibo.it and a pocket calculator only. Students cannot make use of the textbook, probability distribution tables, personal notes and mobile phones (smart watch or similar electronic data storage or communication device are not allowed either).\nDuring the semester, students will have the opportunity to take the full exam in three different appelli through the academic year, or to split assessment by taking a midterm halfway through the course, and then a final during the regular appelli (the overall grade is the average of the two tests).\nThe midterm will cover topics of Descriptive Statistics. It will include exercises and short essays.\nThe final will cover topics of Probability, Statistical Inference and Programming (with R). It will be a mix of multiple choice questions, exercises, and short essays.\nThe full exam will cover the whole course program.\nIn order to sit midterm/final or full exam, students must sign up on Almaesami. Lists generally close 2-3 days before the exam; it won't be possible to be added to the list after the deadline.\nStudents that, despite having passed the exam, do not feel represented by the obtained result can ask to have an additional (optional) oral exam on the whole program that can change the grade by +/-3 points.\nTeaching tools\nSlides available on virtuale.unibo.it\nTutorials.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Laura Anderlucci\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Marco Novelli\n                        \n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Marco Novelli"

The slides provide some context for each topic discussed in class and offer guidance for reading the required papers. The additional readings reported in the syllabus refer to papers mentioned in the slides and can offer further understanding of the general context if some points are not clear enough from the slides themselves (especially for non-attending students).\nFor most topics, you are required to carefully read some research papers (i.e., mandatory papers). It is important to focus on the introduction, design, and identification of the causal effect. You are not required to study all the econometric analyses, just make sure to understand the regression tables reported in the slides. Yet, it is important that you pay attention to the sample selection, attrition, and details of the implementation affecting the analyses and conclusions one can draw from the data. Remember, the main point of the course is to learn how to use lab/field experiments and RCTs to establish a causal effect.\nTo download published papers, you need to be connected via AlmaWIFI. If you are not on campus, please use the library webpage and your UniBo credentials: https://sba.unibo.it/en/homepage -- select AlmaSmart, Single search in AlmaStart for print and online library resources (books, articles, journals, databases, AlmaRE, and AlmaDL Collections).\nTeaching methods\nThe course comprises both traditional lectures and a hands-on laboratory part.\nStudents will have the chance to play simple experiments in class.We will also discuss and analyze data from prominent research papers.\nThe class is designed to be highly interactive and students are expected to prepare presentations, videos/podcasts, and short essays. \nAssessment methods\nFinal written exam of about two hours, or two midterm exams of about one hour each. The second (and final) midterm can be taken only at the first exam session at the end of the semester.\nEach paper and pencil exam will consist of multiple choice questions and open questions.\nOnly students with a sufficiently high grade in the first midterm exam (i.e., 18 or higher) will be admitted to the second one: other candidates must proceed to the full exams.\nFor students taking the midterm exams (esami parziali), the final grade for the course will be the arithmetic average of the grades in the two midterm exams.\nFor students taking the full exam, the grade of the exam is the final grade.\nThe grading system is on a 0-30 scale:\n<18 fail\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 cum laude: excellent\nCandidates are required to register via the University's electronic service (AlmaEsami), where grades will be published.\nAfter exams are graded, students will have the chance to see their graded exam on a date determined by the lecturer.\nStudents will be allowed to reject their final grade for the course at most ONCE. Notification of the intention to reject a grade must be sent via email, within the deadline indicated by the lecturer.\nTeaching tools\nSlides, lecture notes, and readings will be available on the platform VIRTUALE: https://virtuale.unibo.it/\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Stefania Bortolotti"

The slides provide some context for each topic discussed in class and offer guidance for reading the required papers. The additional readings reported in the syllabus refer to papers mentioned in the slides and can offer further understanding of the general context if some points are not clear enough from the slides themselves (especially for non-attending students).\nFor most topics, you are required to carefully read some research papers (i.e., mandatory papers). It is important to focus on the introduction, design, and identification of the causal effect. You are not required to study all the econometric analyses, just make sure to understand the regression tables reported in the slides. Yet, it is important that you pay attention to the sample selection, attrition, and details of the implementation affecting the analyses and conclusions one can draw from the data. Remember, the main point of the course is to learn how to use lab/field experiments and RCTs to establish a causal effect.\nTo download published papers, you need to be connected via AlmaWIFI. If you are not on campus, please use the library webpage and your UniBo credentials: https://sba.unibo.it/en/homepage -- select AlmaSmart, Single search in AlmaStart for print and online library resources (books, articles, journals, databases, AlmaRE, and AlmaDL Collections).\nTeaching methods\nThe course comprises both traditional lectures and a hands-on laboratory part.\nStudents will have the chance to play simple experiments in class.We will also discuss and analyze data from prominent research papers.\nThe class is designed to be highly interactive and students are expected to prepare presentations, videos/podcasts, and short essays. \nAssessment methods\nFinal written exam of about two hours, or two midterm exams of about one hour each. The second (and final) midterm can be taken only at the first exam session at the end of the semester.\nEach paper and pencil exam will consist of multiple choice questions and open questions.\nOnly students with a sufficiently high grade in the first midterm exam (i.e., 18 or higher) will be admitted to the second one: other candidates must proceed to the full exams.\nFor students taking the midterm exams (esami parziali), the final grade for the course will be the arithmetic average of the grades in the two midterm exams.\nFor students taking the full exam, the grade of the exam is the final grade.\nThe grading system is on a 0-30 scale:\n<18 fail\n18-23 sufficient\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30 cum laude: excellent\nCandidates are required to register via the University's electronic service (AlmaEsami), where grades will be published.\nAfter exams are graded, students will have the chance to see their graded exam on a date determined by the lecturer.\nStudents will be allowed to reject their final grade for the course at most ONCE. Notification of the intention to reject a grade must be sent via email, within the deadline indicated by the lecturer.\nTeaching tools\nSlides, lecture notes, and readings will be available on the platform VIRTUALE: https://virtuale.unibo.it/\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Stefania Bortolotti"

        "description": "Learning outcomes\nThe course will investigate the links between financial dynamics and environmental sustainability, with a special focus on climate change and the lowcarbon transition. After an introduction to sustainability and environmental economics, the course will analyse: \ni) the actors, assets and strategies to finance\na sustainable economy; \nii) the risk posed by both environmental and transition\nrisks to financial institutions and the stability of the financial system. \nFinally, the course will offer an overview of the ongoing and possible sustainable finance policy strategies.\nCourse contents\nThe course is made of two modules. The first module (30h) will take place in the first sub-cycle of the second semester. The second module (15h) will take place in the second sub-cycle of the second semester. The course will cover the following topics:\n\nIntroduction to sustainability; climate change: physical basis and impacts; the low-carbon transition\nMoney, finance and ecological systems; physical/transition/liability financial risks\nSustainable investment: motives and strategies; ESG ratings; impact investing\nGreen equities; green bonds; portfolio optimisation; green premium\nPublic finance for sustainable development\nSustainable finance policy-making (taxonomy, benchmarks, standards)\nCentral banks and climate change; green monetary policy; climate stress testing\n\nReadings/Bibliography\nMost of the readings will be in the form of academic articles or policy reports.

Freely available at: http://www.thierry-roncalli.com/SustainableFinanceBook.html\nSchoenmaker and Schramade (2019) Principles of Sustainable Finance; Oxford University Press\n\nTeaching methods\nThe course will be a combination of frontal lectures, in-class exercises and student-led presentations/discussions.\nAssessment methods\nThe grade for the course will be the combination of:\n\nProblem sets. Students will submit empirical problem sets at regular frequency during the course (each counting for 5% of the total grade). Submission is individual, and will take place through Virtuale.\nGroup-work. Each student will self-allocate to a topic group (of between three and five members). Topics will be chosen among the ones provided by lecturer, but alternative topic proposals will be considered. Each group will: i) present the conclusions of their work to the class; ii) submit a related essay via Virtuale.\nExam. A written exam for the module will take place at the end of the course. The exam will include open essay-style questions, exercises and/or multiple choice questions. The exam will last one hour.\n\nThe overall grade for the integrated course will be a simple average of the grades for the two modules. Grading is as follows:\n\n<18 fail\n18-23 pass\n24-27 good\n28-30 very good\n30L excellent\n\nTeaching tools\nAll the course material (slides, readings etc.) will be made available on Virtuale.\nOffice hours\n\n                    See the website of\n                    \n                        Emanuele Campiglio\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n                        See the website of\n                        \n                            Henk Jan Reinders"
